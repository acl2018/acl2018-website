Our purpose is to improve the quality of the review process. The data will be compiled into a unique corpus for NLP, and will be made available to the research community after appropriate anonymization checks, at the earliest in 2 years after ACL 2018. We hope to provide data on "how to review" to younger researchers, and improve the  transparency of the reviewing process in general.

By default, you agree that your anonymised review can be freely used for research purposes and published under an appropriate open-source license no earlier than 2 years from ACL 2018.

<li> 4 = Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully. It's unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed something that should affect my ratings. </li>
<li> 3 = Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math, experimental design, or novelty. </li>
<li> 2 = Willing to defend my evaluation, but it is fairly likely that I missed some details, didn't understand some central points, or can't be sure about the novelty of the work. </li>
<li> 1 = Not my area, or paper was hard for me to understand. My evaluation is just an educated guess. </li>

The [visa information site](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visi/visi) of the Australian Department of Home Affairs is the authoritative source of information about visa requirements for visitors to Australia, including the application process, and you should check that site for the most comprehensive and up-to-date information. 

In general, if you do not have a current Australian passport, you will require a visa of some kind to attend the conference. Please use the [Home Affair Visa Finder](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visa-1) to determine which class of visa you require. The [Home Affairs travel site](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/) also contains additional information about travelling to Australia. 

#### Support Letters for Visa applications

Some classes of visa may require support letters from the conference organizers. If you require such a letter, please fill in [this form](https://icmsaust.eventsair.com/acl-2018/online-letter-visa-request).

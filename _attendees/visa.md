The [visa information site](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visi/visi) of the Australian Department of Home Affairs is the authoritative source of information about visa requirements for visitors to Australia, including the application process. The [Home Affairs travel site](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/) also contains additional information about travelling to Australia. Any further information in this section is provided for convenience only, and you should check the Home Affairs site for the most comprehensive and up-to-date information.

In general, if you do not have a current Australian passport, you will require a visa of some kind to attend the conference. Please make sure you leave enough time for your visa application to be processed. The processing time depends on the class of visa you apply for.
Holders of passports from certain countries are eligible for an [electronic travel authority (ETA) visa](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visa-1/601-), which may be processed more quickly (and cheaply) than [the non-ETA visitor visa](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visa-1/600-).

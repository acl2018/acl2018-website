In keeping with recent ACLs, the ACL 2018 Social Event will be held in
an aquarium.  The [Melbourne Sealife Aquarium](https://www.melbourneaquarium.com.au/) is a short 10 minute walk upriver
along the Yarra from the convention centre (see map on [Attendees page](attendees.md)).

The event runs from 19:30-22:30 and you will be served deserts and drinks, including
an open bar.  Be sure to see the massive `Mermaid Garden', a walk-through glass
passageway amongst hundreds of sharks and thousands more marine
creatures, just a taste of the extraordinary marine diversity of
Australia. See if you can beat the enormous crocodile in a staring contest.

Bring your partners and children to enjoy this spectacular
place. Note that most of the creatures will be on display, although it
will be limited light in the penguin enclosure, to simulate night-time conditions.

Note that dinner is not provided, and there is a limited time for dinner
between the end of the conference programme and the start of the social
event.  Please plan accordingly.  There are many dinner venues
along the river foreshore as part of the South Wharf, Casino (which is
directly opposite the Acquarium), and Southbank precincts. See the [Attendees page](attendees.md) for details.

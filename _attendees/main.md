The MCEC conference venue is located on the south-west corner of Melbourne city center ('CBD').
It can be [reached easily](https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Melbourne-Airport-MEL/1-Convention-Centre-Pl-South-Wharf-VIC-3006-Australia) from the main Tullamarine airport (code: MEL), using a taxi or the cheaper SkyBus bus service. 
The trip takes 30-45 minutes and costs range from about $60 for a taxi to $19 for the bus, and both services depart on the ground level of the airport, near to the baggage claim area. 
For the SkyBus, the [Docklands Express](https://www.skybus.com.au/southbank-docklands-express/) service stops directly outside the MCEC conference venue, as well as several other stops nearby. 
The SkyBus also runs a [Melbourne City Express](https://www.skybus.com.au/melbourne-city-express/) to Southern Cross train station, which is a short 15 minute walk from the conference venue.
Those contemplating renting a car for the trip, be warned that parking in the city centre can be difficult and costly.

If you do arrive at Melbourne's second airport, Avalon (AVV), which services the cheaper carriers, you also have both SkyBus or taxi options, although note that travel times to the city will be about 15 minutes longer.

Melbourne is famous for its trams, and has one of the most extensive tram networks in the world. The CBD is designated a Free Tram Zone, meaning that you can ride any tram for free, although beware, as the Free Tram Zone finishes one stop short of the conference venue and 
ticket inspectors frequent the fringes of the zone trying to catch out
those who ride without a ticket, and are infamous for their intolerance
(including tourists). If you wish to catch a tram beyond the Free Tram
Zone, you will need to purchase a Myki ticket from a newsagent or one of
the many vending machines at tram stops, and 'touch on' each time you
get on a tram. Note that if you touch on within the Free Tram Zone, you
will be charged. No, not the most user-friendly system in the world, but
there are clear announcements in the trams of whether you are in the
Free Tram Zone or not. The same Myki ticket will work on local trains 
and buses, should you need to travel further afield. [Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps) gives
a good overview of public transport options, as does [Public Transport Victoria](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/) and their PTV phone app.

[Uber](https://www.uber.com/en-AU/) operates in Melbourne, and can be cheaper than taxis for short trips.

### Anti-Harassment Policy

### Weather

July is winter time in Melbourne. The average daily maximum is 14°C (58°F),  and you may experience rain or squally winds (along with some sunshine) during your time here as part of the notoriously changeable local weather. Naturally, you should [check the forecast](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml).

For other meals there are several cafes and restaurants within a few minutes walk of the convention centre. Head to the in the South Wharf area (west), where you'll find many good places to choose from, including a food court in  the DFO shopping complex. There are many more eating options available if you head east along the river to Crown and further along at Southbank, including cafes, restaurants and another food court in the Southgate shopping complex.  

Crossing the river and walking a little further to the CBD is worthwhile, where you will find the highest density of restaurants in greater Melbourne. In general, the streets to the east of Elizabeth Street, especially, east of Russell Street, are best for evenings. For an outstanding gelato experience, with experimental flavours, drop into Gelateria Primavera. Chinatown has its spine along Little Bourke Street, including the long-standing Golden Orchids.
Closest to the conference venue, the most vibrant area is near the corner of Katherine Place and Flinders Lane. Further east along Flinders Lane, you can find Dukes coffee roasters. Degraves Street, either side of Flinders Lane, is packed with cafés, and is very popular with visitors and locals alike.

There are several quality rooftop bars in the CBD, including Bomba, Siglo, Campari House, Rooftop Bar (Curtin House), Madame Brussels, and Red Hummingbird. For a view of the city, and of local commuters rushing for their trains, head to the delightful Arbory. Either side, along the Yarra River, Ponyfish Island and Riverland are gems.

Explore Melbourne’s laneways: some of them have amazing places to eat (Hardware Lane, Centre Place, Degraves Street), some have fantastic artwork (Hosier Lane), some are just a little scary looking.

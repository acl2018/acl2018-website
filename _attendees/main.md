The conference will be held in [Melbourne, Australia](https://www.melbourne.org/?utm_source=Microsite&utm_campaign=Computational%20Linguistics) at
the [Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre](http://mcec.com.au/) from July 15th to 20th, 2018.

### Transport

The MCEC conference venue is located on the south-west corner of Melbourne city center ('CBD').
It can be [reached easily](https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Melbourne-Airport-MEL/1-Convention-Centre-Pl-South-Wharf-VIC-3006-Australia) from the main Tullamarine airport (code: MEL), using a taxi or the cheaper SkyBus bus service. 
See also this [google map](https://goo.gl/maps/XqE4jobmbj22), which shows the important ACL locations.
The trip takes 30-45 minutes and costs range from about $60 for a taxi to $19 for the bus, and both services depart on the ground level of the airport, near to the baggage claim area. 
For the SkyBus, the [Docklands Express](https://www.skybus.com.au/southbank-docklands-express/) service stops directly outside the MCEC conference venue, as well as several other stops nearby. 
The SkyBus also runs a [Melbourne City Express](https://www.skybus.com.au/melbourne-city-express/) to Southern Cross train station, which is a short 15 minute walk from the conference venue.
Those contemplating renting a car for the trip, be warned that parking in the city centre can be difficult and costly.

If you do arrive at Melbourne's second airport, Avalon (AVL), which services the cheaper carriers, you also have both SkyBus or taxi options, although note that travel times to the city will be about 15 minutes longer.

Melbourne is famous for its trams, and has one of the most extensive tram networks in the world. The CBD is designated a Free Tram Zone, meaning that you can ride any tram for free, although beware, as the Free Tram Zone finishes one stop short of the conference venue and 
ticket inspectors frequent the fringes of the zone trying to catch out
those who ride without a ticket, and are infamous for their intolerance
(including tourists). If you wish to catch a tram beyond the Free Tram
Zone, you will need to purchase a Myki ticket from a newsagent or one of
the many vending machines at tram stops, and 'touch on' each time you
get on a tram. Note that if you touch on within the Free Tram Zone, you
will be charged. No, not the most user-friendly system in the world, but
there are clear announcements in the trams of whether you are in the
Free Tram Zone or not. The same Myki ticket will work on local trains 
and busses, should you need to travel further afield. [Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps) gives
a good overview of public transport options, as does [Public Transport Victoria](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/) and their PTV phone app.

[Uber](https://www.uber.com/en-AU/) operates in Melbourne, and can be cheaper than taxis for short trips.

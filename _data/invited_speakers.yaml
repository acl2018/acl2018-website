  title: Deep Neural Networks, and what they’re not very good at
  abstract: |
      Deep Neural Networks have had an incredible impact in a variety of areas 
      within machine learning, including computer vision and natural language 
      processing. Deep Neural Networks use implicit representations that are 
      very high-dimensional, however, and are thus particularly well suited to 
      problems that can be solved by associative recall of previous solutions. 
      They are ill-suited to problems that require human-interpretable 
      representations, explicit manipulation of symbols, or reasoning. The 
      dependency of Deep Neural Networks on large volumes of training data, 
      also means that they are typically only applicable when the problem 
      itself, and the nature of the test data, are predictable long in advance.
      
      The application of Deep Neural Networks to Visual Question Answering has 
      achieved results that would have been thought impossible only a few years 
      ago. It has also thrown a spotlight on the shortcomings of current Deep Nets
      in solving problems that require explicit reasoning, the use of a knowledge
      base, or the ability to learn on the fly. In this talk I will illustrate 
      some of the steps being taken to address these problems, and a new 
      learning-to-learn approach that we hope will combine the power of Deep 
      Learning with the significant benefits of explicit-reasoning-based methods.

  title: Who is the Bridge Between the What and the How
  abstract: |
      This talk reports on over a decade of research where theoretical foundations 
      motivate computational models that produce real world impact in online spaces.
      Both the earliest philosophers of language and the most recent researchers in
      computational approaches to social media analysis have acknowledged the 
      distinction between the what of language, namely its propositional content, 
      and the how of language, or its form, style, or framing. What bridges between 
      these realms are social processes that motivate the linguistic choices that 
      result in specific realizations of propositional content situated within social 
      interactions, designed to achieve social goals. These insights allow researchers
      to make sense of the connection between discussion processes and outcomes from 
      those discussions. These findings motivate on the one hand design of computational
      approaches to real time monitoring of discussion processes and on the other
      hand the design of interventions that support interactions in online spaces
      with the goal of increasing desired outcomes, including learning, health, and 
      wellbeing. 

      As an example, in this talk we probe into a specific quality of 
      discussion referred to as Transactivity. Transactivity is the extent to which 
      a contribution articulates the reasoning of the speaker, that of an interlocutor, 
      and the relation between them. In different contexts, and within very distinct 
      theoretical frameworks, this construct has been associated with solidarity, 
      influence, expertise transfer, and learning. Within the construct of Transactivity,
      the cognitive and social underpinnings are inextricably linked such that modeling 
        the who enables prediction of the connection between the what and the how.

      Dr. Carolyn Rosé is a Professor of Language Technologies and Human-Computer Interaction 
      in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Her research program 
      is focused on better understanding the social and pragmatic nature of conversation, 
      and using this understanding to build computational systems that can improve the efficacy 
      of conversation between people, and between people and computers. In order to pursue these
      goals, she invokes approaches from computational discourse analysis and text mining, 
      conversational agents, and computer supported collaborative learning. Her research group’s
      highly interdisciplinary work, published in 200 peer reviewed publications, is represented 
      in the top venues in 5 fields: namely, Language Technologies, Learning Sciences, Cognitive 
      Science, Educational Technology, and Human-Computer Interaction, with awards in 3 of these 
      fields. She serves as Past President and Inaugural Fellow of the International Society of 
      the Learning Sciences, Chair of the International Alliance to Advance Learning in the 
      Digital Era, and Executive Editor of the International Journal of Computer-Supported 
      Collaborative Learning.

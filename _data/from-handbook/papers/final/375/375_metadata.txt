Abstract#==#The methods proposed recently for specializing word embeddings according to a
particular perspective generally rely on external knowledge. In this article,
we propose Pseudofit, a new method for specializing word embeddings according
to semantic similarity without any external knowledge. Pseudofit exploits the
notion of pseudo-sense for building several representations for each word and
uses these representations for making the initial embeddings more generic. We
illustrate the interest of Pseudofit for acquiring synonyms and study several
variants of Pseudofit according to this perspective.

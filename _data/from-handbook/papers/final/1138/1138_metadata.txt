Abstract#==#In the age of social news, it is important to understand the types of reactions
that are evoked from news sources with various levels of credibility. In the
present work we seek to better understand how users react to trusted and
deceptive news sources across two popular, and very different, social media
platforms. To that end, (1) we develop a model to classify user reactions into
one of nine types, such as answer, elaboration, and question, etc, and (2) we
measure the speed and the type of reaction for trusted and deceptive news
sources for 10.8M Twitter posts and 6.2M Reddit comments. We show that there
are significant differences in the speed and the type of reactions between
trusted and deceptive news sources on Twitter, but far smaller differences on
Reddit.

Abstract#==#For extracting meaningful topics from texts, their structures should be
considered properly. 
In this paper, we aim to analyze structured time-series documents such as
a collection of news articles and a series of scientific papers, 
wherein topics evolve along time depending on multiple topics in
the past and are also related to each other at each time. 
To this end, we propose a dynamic and static topic model, 
which simultaneously considers the dynamic structures of the temporal topic
evolution
and the static structures of the topic hierarchy at each time. 
We show the results of experiments on collections of scientific papers,
in which the proposed method outperformed conventional models. 
Moreover, we show an example of extracted topic structures, 
which we found helpful for analyzing research activities.

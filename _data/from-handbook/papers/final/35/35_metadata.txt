Abstract#==#Semantic parsing is the task of transducing natural language (NL)
utterances into formal meaning representations (MRs), commonly
represented as tree structures. Annotating NL utterances with their
corresponding MRs is expensive and time-consuming, and thus the limited
availability of labeled data often becomes the bottleneck of
data-driven, supervised models. We introduce StructVAE, a variational
auto-encoding model for semi-supervised semantic parsing, which learns
both from limited amounts of parallel data, and readily-available
unlabeled NL utterances. StructVAE models latent MRs not observed in the
unlabeled data as tree-structured latent variables. Experiments on
semantic parsing on the ATIS domain and Python code generation show that
with extra unlabeled data, StructVAE outperforms strong supervised models.

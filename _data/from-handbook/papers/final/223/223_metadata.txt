Abstract#==#We highlight a practical yet rarely discussed problem in dialogue state
tracking (DST), namely handling unknown slot values. Previous approaches
generally assume predefined candidate lists and thus are not designed to output
unknown values, especially when the spoken language understanding (SLU) module
is absent as in many end-to-end (E2E) systems. We describe in this paper an E2E
architecture based on the pointer network (PtrNet) that can effectively extract
unknown slot values while still obtains state-of-the-art accuracy on the
standard DSTC2 benchmark. We also provide extensive empirical evidence to show
that tracking unknown values can be challenging and our approach can bring
significant improvement with the help of an effective feature dropout
technique.

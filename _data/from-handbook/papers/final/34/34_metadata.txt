Abstract#==#Human generates responses relying on semantic and functional dependencies,
including coreference relation, among dialogue elements and their context. In
this paper, we investigate matching a response with its multi-turn context
using dependency information based entirely on attention. Our solution is
inspired by the recently proposed Transformer in machine translation (Vaswani
et al., 2017) and we
extend the attention mechanism in two ways. First, we construct representations
of text segments at different granularities solely with stacked self-attention.
Second, we try to extract the truly matched segment pairs with attention across
the context and response. We jointly introduce those two kinds of attention in
one uniform
neural network. Experiments on two large-scale multi-turn response selection
tasks show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

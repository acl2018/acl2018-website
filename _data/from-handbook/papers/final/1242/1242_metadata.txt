Abstract#==#To achieve high translation performance, neural machine translation models
usually rely on the beam search algorithm for decoding sentences. The beam
search finds good candidate translations by considering multiple hypotheses of
translations simultaneously. However, as the algorithm produces hypotheses in a
monotonic left-to-right order, a hypothesis can not be revisited once it is
discarded. We found such monotonicity forces the algorithm to sacrifice some
good decoding paths. To mitigate this problem, we relax the monotonic
constraint of the beam search by maintaining all found hypotheses in a single
priority queue and using a universal score function for hypothesis selection.
The proposed algorithm allows discarded hypotheses to be recovered in a later
step. Despite its simplicity, we show that the proposed decoding algorithm
enhances the quality of selected hypotheses and improve the translations even
for high-performance models in English-Japanese translation task.

Abstract#==#Asking good questions in open-domain conversational systems is quite
significant but rather untouched. This task, substantially different from
traditional question generation, requires to question not only with various
patterns but also on diverse and relevant topics. We observe that a good
question is a natural composition of interrogatives, topic words, and ordinary
words. Interrogatives lexicalize the pattern of questioning, topic words
address the key information for topic transition in dialogue, and ordinary
words play syntactical and grammatical roles in making a natural sentence. 
We devise two typed decoders (soft typed decoder and hard typed decoder) in
which a type distribution over the three types is estimated and the type
distribution is used to modulate the final generation distribution. Extensive
experiments show that the typed decoders outperform state-of-the-art baselines
and can generate more meaningful questions.

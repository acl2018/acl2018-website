Abstract#==#Software developers and testers have long struggled with how to elicit
proactive responses from their coworkers when reviewing code for security
vulnerabilities and errors. For a code review to be successful, it must not
only identify potential problems but also elicit an active response from the
colleague responsible for modifying the code. To understand the factors that
contribute to this outcome, we analyze a novel dataset of more than one million
code reviews for the Google Chromium project, from which we extract linguistic
features of feedback that elicited responsive actions from coworkers. Using a
manually-labeled subset of reviewer comments, we trained a highly accurate
classifier to identify acted-upon comments (AUC = 0.85). Our results
demonstrate the utility of our dataset, the feasibility of using NLP for this
new task, and the potential of NLP to improve our understanding of how
communications between colleagues can be authored to elicit positive, proactive
responses.

Abstract#==#Metric validation in Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is currently done by
observing
  the correlation between human and metric-induced rankings. 
        However, such correlation studies are costly, 
  methodologically troublesome, and suffer from low inter-rater agreement.
  We propose \maege, an automatic methodology for GEC metric validation,
  that overcomes many of the difficulties in the existing methodology.
  Experiments with \maege\ shed a new light on metric quality, 
  showing for example that the standard $M^2$ metric fares poorly on
corpus-level ranking.
        Moreover, we use \maege\ to perform a detailed analysis of metric
        behavior, showing that some types of valid edits are consistently
  penalized by existing metrics.

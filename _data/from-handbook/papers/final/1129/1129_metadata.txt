Abstract#==#Sarcasm is a sophisticated speech act which commonly manifests on social
communities such as Twitter and Reddit. The prevalence of sarcasm on the social
web is highly disruptive to opinion mining systems due to not only its tendency
of polarity flipping but also usage of figurative language. Sarcasm commonly
manifests with a contrastive theme either between positive-negative sentiments
or between literal-figurative scenarios. In this paper, we revisit the notion
of modeling contrast in order to reason with sarcasm. More specifically, we
propose an attention-based neural model that looks in-between instead of
across, enabling it to explicitly model contrast and incongruity. We conduct
extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from Twitter, Reddit and the
Internet Argument Corpus. Our proposed model not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance on all datasets but also enjoys improved interpretability.

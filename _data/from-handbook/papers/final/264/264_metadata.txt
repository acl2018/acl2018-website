Abstract#==#Answer selection is an important subtask of community question answering (CQA).
In a real-world CQA forum, a question is often represented as two parts: a
subject that summarizes the main points of the question, and a body that
elaborates on the subject in detail. Previous researches on answer selection
usually ignored the difference between these two parts and concatenated them as
the question representation. In this paper, we propose the Question Condensing
Networks (QCN) to make use of the subject-body relationship of community
questions. In our model, the question subject is the primary part of the
question representation, and the question body information is aggregated based
on similarity and disparity with the question subject. Experimental results
show that QCN outperforms all existing models on two CQA datasets.

Abstract#==#Training language models for Code-mixed (CM) language is known to be a
difficult problem because of lack of data compounded by the increased
confusability due to the presence of more than one language. We present a
computational technique for creation of grammatically valid artificial CM data
based on the Equivalence Constraint Theory. We show that when training examples
are sampled appropriately from this synthetic data and presented in certain
order (aka training curriculum) along with monolingual and real CM data, it can
significantly reduce the perplexity of an RNN-based language model. We also
show that randomly generated CM data does not help in decreasing the perplexity
of the LMs.

Abstract#==#Modeling derivational morphology to generate words with particular semantics is
useful in many text generation tasks, such as machine translation or
abstractive question answering. In this work, we tackle the task of derived
word generation. That is, we attempt to generate the word "runner" for "someone
who runs." We identify two key problems in generating derived words from root
words and transformations. We contribute a novel aggregation model of derived
word generation that learns derivational transformations both as orthographic
functions using sequence-to-sequence models and as functions in distributional
word embedding space. The model then learns to choose between the hypothesis of
each system. We also present two ways of incorporating corpus information into
derived word generation.

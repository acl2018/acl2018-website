Abstract#==#We consider the problem of learning textual
entailment models with limited supervision
(5K-10K training examples), and
present two complementary approaches
for it. First, we propose knowledge-guided
adversarial example generators for incorporating
large lexical resources in entailment
models via only a handful of rule
templates. Second, to make the entailment
model—a discriminator—more robust, we
propose the first GAN-style approach for
training it using a natural language example
generator that iteratively adjusts to the
discriminator’s weaknesses. We demonstrate
effectiveness using two entailment
datasets, where the proposed methods increase
accuracy by 4.7% on SciTail and
by 2.8% on a 1% sub-sample of SNLI.
Notably, even a single hand-written rule,
negate, improves the accuracy of negation
examples in SNLI by 6.1%.

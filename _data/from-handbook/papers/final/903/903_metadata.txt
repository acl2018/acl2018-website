Abstract#==#Recent neural network models for Chinese zero pronoun resolution gain great
performance by capturing semantic information for zero pronouns and candidate
antecedents, but tend to be short-sighted, operating solely by making local
decisions. They typically predict coreference links between the zero pronoun
and one single candidate antecedent at a time while ignoring their influence on
future decisions. Ideally, modeling useful information of preceding potential
antecedents is crucial for classifying later zero pronoun-candidate antecedent
pairs, a need which leads traditional models of zero pronoun resolution to draw
on reinforcement learning. In this paper, we show how to integrate these goals,
applying deep reinforcement learning to deal with the task. With the help of
the reinforcement learning agent, our system learns the policy of selecting
antecedents in a sequential manner, where useful information provided by
earlier predicted antecedents could be utilized for making later coreference
decisions. Experimental results on OntoNotes 5.0 show that our approach
substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under three experimental
settings.

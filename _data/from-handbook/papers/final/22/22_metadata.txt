Abstract#==#The relational facts in sentences are often complicated. Different relational
triplets may have overlaps in a sentence. We divided the sentences into three
types according to triplet overlap degree, including Normal,
EntityPairOverlap and SingleEntiyOverlap. Existing methods mainly focus on
Normal
class and fail to extract relational triplets precisely. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end model based on sequence-to-sequence learning with copy
mechanism, which can jointly extract relational facts from sentences of any of
these classes. We adopt two different strategies in decoding process: employing
only one united decoder or applying multiple separated decoders. We test our
models in two public datasets and our model outperform the baseline method
significantly.

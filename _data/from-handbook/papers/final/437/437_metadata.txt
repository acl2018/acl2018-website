Abstract#==#Chart constraints, which specify at which string positions a
  constituent may begin or end, have been shown to speed up chart
  parsers for PCFGs. We generalize chart constraints to more
  expressive grammar formalisms and describe a neural tagger which
  predicts chart constraints at very high precision. Our constraints
  accelerate both PCFG and TAG parsing, and combine effectively with
  other pruning techniques (coarse-to-fine and supertagging) for an
  overall speedup of two orders of magnitude, while improving
  accuracy.

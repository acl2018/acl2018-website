Abstract#==#Verb-noun combinations (VNCs) - e.g., blow the whistle, hit the roof, and
see stars - are a common type of English idiom that are ambiguous with
literal usages. In this paper we propose and evaluate models for classifying
VNC usages as idiomatic or literal, based on a variety of approaches to forming
distributed representations. Our results show that a model based on averaging
word embeddings performs on par with, or better than, a previously-proposed
approach based on skip-thoughts. Idiomatic usages of VNCs are known to exhibit
lexico-syntactic fixedness. We further incorporate this information into our
models, demonstrating that this rich linguistic knowledge is complementary to
the information carried by distributed representations.

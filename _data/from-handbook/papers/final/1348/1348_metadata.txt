Abstract#==#We introduce the novel task of predicting adverbial presupposition triggers,
which is useful for natural language generation tasks such as summarization and
dialogue systems. We introduce two new corpora, derived from the Penn Treebank
and the Annotated English Gigaword dataset and investigate the use of a novel
attention mechanism tailored to this task. Our attention mechanism augments a
baseline recurrent neural network without the need for additional trainable
parameters, minimizing the added computational cost of our mechanism.  We
demonstrate that this model statistically outperforms our baselines.

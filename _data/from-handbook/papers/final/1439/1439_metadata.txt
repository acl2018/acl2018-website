Abstract#==#End-to-end learning framework is useful for building dialog systems for its
simplicity in training and efficiency in model updating. However, current
end-to-end approaches only consider user semantic inputs in learning and
under-utilize other user information. Therefore, we propose to include user
sentiment obtained through multimodal information (acoustic, dialogic and
textual), in the end-to-end learning framework to make systems more
user-adaptive and effective.
We incorporated user sentiment information in both supervised and reinforcement
learning settings. In both settings, adding sentiment information reduced the
dialog length and improved the task success rate on a bus information search
task. This work is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal user information
in the adaptive end-to-end dialog system training framework and attained
state-of-the-art performance.

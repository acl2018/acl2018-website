Abstract#==#Existing solutions to task-oriented dialogue systems follow
pipeline designs which introduces architectural complexity and
fragility. We propose a novel, holistic, extendable framework
based on a single sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model which 
can be optimized with supervised
or reinforcement learning. A key contribution is that we
design text spans named belief spans to track dialogue
believes, allowing task-oriented dialogue systems to be modeled in a
seq2seq way. Based on this, we propose a simplistic Two
Stage CopyNet instantiation which emonstrates good scalability:
significantly reducing model complexity in terms of number of
parameters and training time by a magnitude.  It significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art pipeline-based methods on large
datasets and retains a satisfactory entity match rate on
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) cases where pipeline-designed competitors
totally fail.

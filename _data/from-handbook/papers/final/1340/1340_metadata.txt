Abstract#==#Previous approaches to multilingual semantic dependency parsing treat languages
independently, without exploiting the similarities between semantic structures
across languages.
We experiment with a new approach where we combine resources from different
languages in the CoNLL 2009 shared task to build a single polyglot semantic
dependency parser.
Notwithstanding the absence of parallel data, and the dissimilarity in
annotations between languages, our approach results in improvement in parsing
performance on several languages over a monolingual baseline.
Analysis of the polyglot models' performance provides a new understanding of
the similarities and differences between languages in the shared task.

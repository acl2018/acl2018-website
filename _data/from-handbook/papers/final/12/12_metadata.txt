Abstract#==#An abugida is a writing system where the consonant letters represent syllables
with a default vowel and other vowels are denoted by diacritics. We investigate
the feasibility of recovering the original text written in an abugida after
omitting subordinate diacritics and merging consonant letters with similar
phonetic values. This is crucial for developing more efficient input methods by
reducing the complexity in abugidas. Four abugidas in the southern Brahmic
family, i.e., Thai, Burmese, Khmer, and Lao, were studied using a newswire
20,000-sentence dataset. We compared the recovery performance of a support
vector machine and an LSTM-based recurrent neural network, finding that the
abugida graphemes could be recovered with 94% - 97% accuracy at the top-1 level
and 98% - 99% at the top-4 level, even after omitting most diacritics (10 - 30
types) and merging the remaining 30 - 50 characters into 21 graphemes.

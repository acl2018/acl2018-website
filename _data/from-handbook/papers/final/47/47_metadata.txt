Abstract#==#We investigate the influence that document context exerts on human
acceptability judgements for English sentences, via two sets of
experiments. The first compares ratings for sentences presented
on their own with ratings for the same set of sentences given in their
document contexts.  The second assesses the accuracy with which two
types of neural models --- one that incorporates context during training
and one that does not --- predict these judgements.  Our results
indicate that: (1) context improves acceptability ratings for ill-formed
sentences, but also reduces them for well-formed sentences;  and (2)
context helps unsupervised systems to model
acceptability.

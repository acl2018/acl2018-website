Abstract#==#Embedding methods which enforce a partial order or lattice structure over the
concept space, such as Order Embeddings (OE), are a natural way to model
transitive relational data (e.g. entailment graphs). However, OE learns a
deterministic knowledge base, limiting expressiveness of queries and the
ability to use uncertainty  for both prediction and learning (e.g. learning
from expectations). Probabilistic extensions of OE  have provided the ability
to somewhat calibrate these denotational probabilities while retaining the
consistency and inductive bias of ordered models, but lack the ability to model
the negative correlations found in real-world knowledge. In this work we show
that a broad class of models that assign probability measures to OE can never
capture negative correlation, which motivates our construction of a novel box
lattice and accompanying probability measure to capture anti-correlation and
even disjoint concepts, while still providing the benefits of probabilistic
modeling, such as the ability to perform rich joint and conditional queries
over arbitrary sets of concepts, and both learning from and predicting
calibrated uncertainty. We show improvements over previous approaches in
modeling the Flickr and WordNet entailment graphs, and investigate the power of
the model.

Abstract#==#Treebank conversion is a straightforward and effective way to exploit 
various heterogeneous treebanks for boosting parsing performance.
However, previous work mainly focuses on unsupervised treebank 
conversion and has made little progress due to the lack of manually 
labeled data where each sentence has two syntactic trees complying 
with two different guidelines at the same time, referred as 
bi-tree aligned data. 

In this work, we for the first time propose the task of supervised treebank
conversion. First, we manually construct a bi-tree aligned dataset containing
over ten thousand sentences. Then, we propose two simple yet effective
conversion
approaches (pattern embedding and treeLSTM) based on the state-of-the-art deep
biaffine parser. Experimental results show that 1) the two conversion
approaches achieve comparable conversion accuracy, and 2) treebank conversion
is  superior to the widely used multi-task learning framework in multi-treebank
exploitation and leads to significantly higher parsing accuracy.

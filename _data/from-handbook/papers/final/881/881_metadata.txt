Abstract#==#Recent BIO-tagging-based neural semantic role labeling models are very high
performing, but assume gold predicates as part of the input and cannot
incorporate span-level features. We propose an end-to-end approach for jointly
predicting all predicates, arguments spans, and the relations between them. The
model makes independent decisions about what relationship, if any, holds
between every possible word-span pair, and learns contextualized span
representations that provide rich, shared input features for each decision.
Experiments demonstrate that this approach sets a new state of the art on
PropBank SRL without gold predicates.

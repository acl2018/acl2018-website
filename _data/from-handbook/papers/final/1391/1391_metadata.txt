Abstract#==#We demonstrate that an SHRG-based parser can produce semantic graphs much more
accurately than previously shown, by relating synchronous production rules to
the syntacto-semantic composition process. Our parser achieves an accuracy of
90.35 for EDS (89.51 for DMRS) in terms of elementary dependency match, which
is a 4.87 (5.45) point improvement over the best existing data-driven model,
indicating, in our view, the importance of linguistically-informed derivation
for data-driven semantic parsing. This accuracy is equivalent to that of
English Resource Grammar guided models, suggesting that (recurrent) neural
network models are able to effectively learn deep linguistic knowledge from
annotations.

Abstract#==#Semantic hashing has become a powerful paradigm for fast similarity search in
many information retrieval systems. While fairly successful, previous
techniques generally require two-stage training, and the binary constraints are
handled \emph{ad-hoc}. In this paper, we present an \emph{end-to-end} Neural
Architecture for Semantic Hashing (NASH), where the binary hashing codes are
treated as \emph{Bernoulli} latent variables. A neural variational inference
framework is proposed for training, where gradients are directly backpropagated
through the discrete latent variable to optimize the hash function. We also
draw the connections between proposed method and \emph{rate-distortion theory},
which provides a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of our framework.
Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on both
\emph{unsupervised} and \emph{supervised} scenarios.

Abstract#==#To be informative, an evaluation must measure how well systems generalize to
realistic unseen data. We identify limitations of and propose improvements to
current evaluations of text-to-SQL systems. First, we compare human-generated
and automatically generated questions, characterizing properties of queries
necessary for real-world applications. To facilitate evaluation on multiple
datasets, we release standardized and improved versions of seven existing
datasets and one new text-to-SQL dataset. Second, we show that the current
division of data into training and test sets measures robustness to variations
in the way questions are asked, but only partially tests how well systems
generalize to new queries; therefore, we propose a complementary dataset split
for evaluation of future work. Finally, we demonstrate how the common practice
of anonymizing variables during evaluation removes an important challenge of the task.
Our observations highlight key difficulties, and our methodology enables
effective measurement of future development.

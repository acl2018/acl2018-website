Abstract#==#Sentence function is a significant factor to achieve the purpose of the
speaker, which, however, has not been touched in large-scale conversation
generation so far. In this paper, we present a model to generate informative
responses with controlled sentence function. Our model utilizes a continuous
latent variable to capture various word patterns that realize the expected
sentence function, and introduces a type controller to deal with the
compatibility of controlling sentence function and generating informative
content. Conditioned on the latent variable, the type controller determines
the type (i.e., function-related, topic, and ordinary word) of a word to be
generated at each decoding position. Experiments show that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and it has the ability to generate
responses with both controlled sentence function and informative content.

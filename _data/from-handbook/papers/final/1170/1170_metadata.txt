Abstract#==#Heuristic-based active learning (AL) methods are limited when the data
distribution of the underlying learning problems vary. We introduce a method
that learns an AL "policy" using "imitation learning" (IL). Our IL-based
approach makes use of an efficient and effective "algorithmic expert", which
provides the policy learner with good actions in the encountered AL situations.
The AL strategy is then learned with a feedforward network, mapping situations
to most informative query datapoints. We evaluate our method on two different
tasks: text classification and named entity recognition. Experimental results
show that our IL-based AL strategy is more effective than strong previous
methods using heuristics and reinforcement learning.

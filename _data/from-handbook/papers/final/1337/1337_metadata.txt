Abstract#==#Identification of distinct and independent participants (entities of interest)
in a narrative is an important task for many NLP applications. This task
becomes challenging because these participants are often referred to using
multiple aliases.  In this paper, we propose an approach based on linguistic
knowledge for identification of aliases mentioned using proper nouns, pronouns
or noun phrases with common noun headword. We use Markov Logic Network (MLN) to
encode the linguistic knowledge for identification of aliases. We evaluate on
four diverse history narratives of varying complexity. Our approach performs
better than the state-of-the-art approach as well as a combination of standard
named entity recognition and coreference resolution techniques.

Abstract#==#Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) aims to identify the correct meaning of
polysemous words in the particular context.
Lexical resources like WordNet which are proved to be of great help for WSD in
the knowledge-based methods.
However, previous neural networks for WSD always rely on massive labeled data
(context), ignoring lexical resources like glosses (sense definitions).
In this paper, we integrate the context and glosses of the target word into a
unified framework in order to make full use of both labeled data and lexical
knowledge.
Therefore, we propose GAS: a gloss-augmented WSD neural network which jointly
encodes the context and glosses of the target word. 
GAS models the semantic relationship between the context and the gloss in an
improved memory network framework, which breaks the barriers of the previous
supervised methods and knowledge-based methods.
We further extend the original gloss of word sense via its semantic relations
in WordNet to enrich the gloss information.
The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
systems on several English all-words WSD datasets.

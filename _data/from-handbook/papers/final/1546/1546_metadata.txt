Abstract#==#Most of the current abstractive text summarization models are based on the
sequence-to-sequence model (Seq2Seq). The source content of social media is
long and noisy, so it is difficult for Seq2Seq to learn an accurate semantic
representation. Compared with the source content, the annotated summary is
short and well written. Moreover, it shares the same meaning as the source
content. In this work, we supervise the learning of the representation of the
source content with that of the summary. In implementation, we regard a summary
autoencoder as an assistant supervisor of Seq2Seq. Following previous work, we
evaluate our model on a popular Chinese social media dataset. Experimental
results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performances on the
benchmark dataset.

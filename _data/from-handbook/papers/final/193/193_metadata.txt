Abstract#==#Tree-based neural machine translation (NMT) approaches, although achieved
impressive performance, suffer from a major drawback: they only use the 1-best
parse tree to direct the translation, which potentially introduces translation
mistakes due to parsing errors. For statistical machine translation (SMT),
forest-based methods have been proven to be effective for solving this problem,
while for NMT this kind of approach has not been attempted. This paper proposes
a forest-based NMT method that translates a linearized packed forest under a
simple sequence-to-sequence framework (i.e., a forest-to-sequence NMT model).
The BLEU score of the proposed method is higher than that of the
sequence-to-sequence NMT, tree-based NMT, and forest-based SMT systems.

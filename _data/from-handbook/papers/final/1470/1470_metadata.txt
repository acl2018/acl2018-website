Abstract#==#Effectively using full syntactic parsing information in Neural Networks (NNs)
for solving relational tasks, e.g., question similarity, is still an open
problem. In this paper, we propose to inject structural representations in NNs
by (i) learning a model with Tree Kernels (TKs) on relatively few pairs of
questions (few thousands) as gold standard (GS) training data is typically
scarce, (ii) predicting labels on a very large corpus of question pairs, and
(iii)  pre-training NNs on such large corpus. The results on Quora and SemEval
question similarity datasets show that NNs using our approach can learn more
accurate models, especially after fine tuning on  GS.

Abstract#==#Story comprehension requires a deep semantic understanding of the narrative,
making it a challenging task. Inspired by previous studies on ROC Story Cloze
Test, we propose a novel method, tracking various semantic aspects with
external neural memory chains while encouraging each to focus on a particular
semantic aspect. Evaluated on the task of story ending prediction, our model
demonstrates superior performance to a collection of competitive baselines,
setting a new state of the art.

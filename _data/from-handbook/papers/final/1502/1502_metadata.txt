Abstract#==#Morphological analysis involves predicting the syntactic traits of a word (e.g.
{POS: Noun, Case: Acc, Gender: Fem}). Previous work in morphological tagging
improves performance for low-resource languages (LRLs) through cross-lingual
training with a high-resource language (HRL) from the same family, but is
limited by the strict, often false, assumption that tag sets exactly overlap
between the HRL and LRL. In this paper we propose a method for cross-lingual
morphological tagging that aims to improve information sharing between
languages by relaxing this assumption. The proposed model uses factorial
conditional random fields with neural network potentials, making it possible to
(1) utilize the expressive power of neural network representations to smooth
over superficial differences in the surface forms, (2) model pairwise and
transitive relationships between tags, and (3) accurately generate tag sets
that are unseen or rare in the training data. Experiments on four languages
from the Universal Dependencies Treebank demonstrate superior tagging
accuracies over existing cross-lingual approaches.

Abstract#==#A DAG automaton is a formal device for manipulating graphs.
By augmenting a DAG automaton with transduction rules, a DAG transducer has
potential applications in fundamental NLP tasks. 
In this paper, we propose a novel DAG transducer to perform graph-to-program
transformation.
The target structure of our transducer is a program licensed by a declarative
programming language rather than linguistic structures.
By executing such a program, we can easily get a surface string.
Our transducer is designed especially for natural language generation (NLG)
from type-logical semantic graphs.
Taking Elementary Dependency Structures, a format of English Resource
Semantics, as input, our NLG system achieves a BLEU-4 score of 68.07.
This remarkable result demonstrates the feasibility of applying a DAG
transducer to resolve NLG, as well as the effectiveness of our design.

Abstract#==#Most previous seq2seq summarization systems purely depend on the source text to generate summaries, which tends to work unstably.
Inspired by the traditional template-based summarization approaches, this paper proposes to use existing summaries as soft templates to guide the seq2seq model.
To this end, we use a popular IR platform to Retrieve proper summaries as
candidate templates.  
Then, we extend the seq2seq framework to jointly conduct template Reranking and template-aware summary generation (Rewriting).
Experiments show that, in terms of informativeness, our model significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and even soft templates themselves
demonstrate high competitiveness.
In addition, the import of high-quality external summaries improves the
stability and readability of generated summaries.

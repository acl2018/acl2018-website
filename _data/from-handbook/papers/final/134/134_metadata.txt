Abstract#==#Building intelligent agents that can communicate with and learn from humans in
natural language is of great value. Supervised language learning is limited by
the ability of capturing mainly the statistics of training data, and is hardly
adaptive to new scenarios or flexible for acquiring new knowledge without
inefficient retraining or catastrophic forgetting.
We highlight the perspective that conversational interaction serves as a
natural interface  both for  language learning and  for novel knowledge
acquisition and  propose a joint imitation and reinforcement approach for
grounded language learning through an interactive conversational game. The
agent trained with this approach is able to actively acquire information by
asking questions about novel objects and use the just-learned knowledge in
subsequent conversations in a one-shot fashion. 
Results compared with other methods verified the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

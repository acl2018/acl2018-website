Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the problem of finding a novel document descriptor
based on the covariance matrix of the word vectors of a document. Our
descriptor has a fixed length, which makes it easy to use in many supervised
and unsupervised applications. We tested our novel descriptor in different
tasks including supervised and unsupervised settings. Our evaluation shows
that our document covariance descriptor fits different tasks with competitive
performance against state-of-the-art methods.

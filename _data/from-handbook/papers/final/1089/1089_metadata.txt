Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a joint architecture
that captures language, rhyme and meter for sonnet modelling.  We assess
the quality of generated poems using crowd and expert judgements.  The
stress and rhyme models perform very well, as generated poems are
largely indistinguishable from human-written poems.  Expert evaluation,
however, reveals that a vanilla language model captures meter implicitly,
and that machine-generated poems still underperform in terms of
readability and emotion. Our research shows the importance expert
evaluation for poetry generation, and that future research should look
beyond rhyme/meter and focus on poetic language.

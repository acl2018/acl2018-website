Abstract#==#We investigate the behavior of maps
learned by machine translation methods.
The maps translate words by projecting
between word embedding spaces of different
languages. We locally approximate
these maps using linear maps, and find
that they vary across the word embedding
space. This demonstrates that the underlying
maps are non-linear. Importantly, we
show that the locally linear maps vary by
an amount that is tightly correlated with
the distance between the neighborhoods
on which they are trained. Our results can
be used to test non-linear methods, and to
drive the design of more accurate maps for
word translation.

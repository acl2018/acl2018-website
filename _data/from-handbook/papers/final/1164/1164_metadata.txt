Abstract#==#Semantic parsing requires training data that is expensive and slow to collect. 
We apply active learning to both traditional and "overnight" data collection
approaches. 
We show that it is possible to obtain good training hyperparameters from
seed data which is only a small fraction of the full dataset. We show that
uncertainty sampling based on least confidence score is competitive in
traditional data collection but not applicable for overnight collection. We
propose several active learning strategies for overnight data collection and
show that different example selection strategies per domain perform best.

Abstract#==#Unsupervised machine translation - i.e., not assuming any cross-lingual
supervision signal, whether a dictionary, translations, or comparable corpora -
seems impossible, but nevertheless, Lample et al. (2017) recently proposed a
fully unsupervised machine translation (MT) model. The model relies heavily on
an adversarial, unsupervised cross-lingual word embedding technique for
bilingual dictionary induction (Conneau et al., 2017), which we examine here.
Our results identify the limitations of current unsupervised MT: unsupervised
bilingual dictionary induction performs much worse on morphologically rich
languages that are not dependent marking, when monolingual corpora from
different domains or different embedding algorithms are used. We show that a
simple trick, exploiting a weak supervision signal from identical words,
enables more robust induction and establish a near-perfect correlation between
unsupervised bilingual dictionary induction performance and a previously
unexplored graph similarity metric.

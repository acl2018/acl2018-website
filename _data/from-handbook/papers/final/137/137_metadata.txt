Abstract#==#Due to the ability of encoding and mapping semantic information into a
high-dimensional latent feature space, neural networks have been successfully
used for detecting events to a certain extent. However, such a feature space
can be easily contaminated by spurious features inherent in event detection. In
this paper, we propose a self-regulated learning approach by utilizing a
generative adversarial network to generate spurious features. On the basis, we
employ a recurrent network to eliminate the fakes. Detailed experiments on the
ACE 2005 and TAC-KBP 2015 corpora show that our proposed method is highly
effective and adaptable.

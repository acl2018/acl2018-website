Abstract#==#This paper describes a novel hierarchical attention network for reading
comprehension style question answering, which aims to answer questions for a
given narrative paragraph. In the proposed method, attention and fusion are
conducted horizontally and vertically across layers at different levels of
granularity between question and paragraph. Specifically, it first encode the
question and paragraph with fine-grained language embeddings, to better capture
the respective representations at semantic level. Then it proposes a
multi-granularity fusion approach to fully fuse information from both global
and attended representations. Finally, it introduces a hierarchical attention
network to focuses on the answer span progressively with multi-level
soft-alignment. Extensive experiments on the large-scale SQuAD, TriviaQA
dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. At the time of
writing the paper, our model achieves state-of-the-art on the both SQuAD and
TriviaQA Wiki leaderboard as well as two adversarial SQuAD datasets.

Abstract#==#We introduce a new entity typing task: given a sentence with an entity mention,
the goal is to predict a set of free-form phrases (e.g. skyscraper, songwriter,
or criminal) that describe appropriate types for the target entity. This
formulation allows us to use a new type of distant supervision at large scale:
head words, which indicate the type of the noun phrases they appear in. We show
that these ultra-fine types can be crowd-sourced, and introduce new evaluation
sets that are much more diverse and fine-grained than existing benchmarks. 
We present a model that can predict ultra-fine types, and is trained using a
multitask objective that pools our new head-word supervision with prior
supervision from entity linking. 
Experimental results demonstrate that our model is effective in predicting
entity types at varying granularity; it achieves state of the art performance
on an existing fine-grained entity typing benchmark, and sets baselines for our
newly-introduced datasets.

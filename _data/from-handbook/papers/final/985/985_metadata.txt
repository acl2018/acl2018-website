Abstract#==#Medical imaging is widely used in clinical practice for diagnosis and
treatment. Report-writing can be error-prone for unexperienced physicians, and
time-consuming and tedious for experienced physicians. To address these issues,
we study the automatic generation of medical imaging reports. This task
presents several challenges. First, a complete report contains multiple
heterogeneous forms of information, including findings and tags. Second,
abnormal regions in medical images are difficult to identify. Third, the
reports are typically long, containing multiple sentences. To cope with these
challenges, we (1) build a multi-task learning framework which jointly performs
the prediction of tags and the generation of paragraphs, (2) propose a
co-attention mechanism to localize regions containing abnormalities and
generate narrations for them, (3) develop a hierarchical LSTM model to generate
long paragraphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on
two publicly available dataset.

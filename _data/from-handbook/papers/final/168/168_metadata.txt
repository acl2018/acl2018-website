Abstract#==#Novel neural models have been proposed in recent years for learning under
domain shift. Most models, however, only evaluate on a single task, on
proprietary datasets, or compare to weak baselines, which makes comparison of
models difficult. In this paper, we re-evaluate classic general-purpose
bootstrapping approaches in the context of neural networks under domain shifts
vs. recent neural approaches and propose a novel multi-task tri-training method
that reduces the time and space complexity of classic tri-training. Extensive
experiments on two benchmarks for part-of-speech tagging and sentiment analysis
are negative: while our novel method establishes a new state-of-the-art for
sentiment analysis, it does not fare consistently the best. More importantly,
we arrive at the somewhat surprising conclusion that classic tri-training, with
some additions, outperforms the state-of-the-art for NLP. Hence classic
approaches constitute an important and strong baseline.

Abstract#==#Everyday billions of multimodal posts containing both images and text are
shared in social media sites such as Snapchat, Twitter or Instagram. This
combination of image and text in a single message allows for more creative and
expressive forms of communication, and has become increasingly common in such
sites. This new paradigm brings new challenges for natural language
understanding, as the textual component tends to be shorter, more informal, and
often is only understood if combined with the visual context. In this paper, we
explore the task of name tagging in multimodal social media posts. We start by
creating two new multimodal datasets: the first based on Twitter posts and the
second based on Snapchat captions (exclusively submitted to public and
crowd-sourced stories). We then propose a novel model architecture based on
Visual Attention that not only provides deeper visual understanding on the
decisions of the model, but also significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art baseline methods for this task.

Abstract#==#A homographic pun is a form of wordplay in which one signifier (usually a word)
suggests two or more meanings by exploiting polysemy for an intended humorous
or rhetorical effect. In this paper, we focus on the task of pun location,
which aims to identify the pun word in a given short text. We propose a
sense-aware neural model to address this challenging task. Our model first
obtains several WSD results for the text, and then leverages a bidirectional
LSTM network to model each sequence of word senses. The outputs at each time
step for different LSTM networks are then concatenated for prediction.
Evaluation results on the benchmark SemEval 2017 dataset demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed model.

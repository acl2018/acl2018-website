Abstract#==#Generating emotional language is a key step towards building empathetic natural
language processing agents. However, a major challenge for this line of
research is the lack of large-scale labeled training data, and previous studies
are limited to only small sets of human annotated sentiment labels.
Additionally, explicitly controlling the emotion and sentiment of generated
text is also difficult. In this paper, we take a more radical approach: we
exploit the idea of leveraging Twitter data that are naturally labeled with
emojis.

We collect a large corpus of Twitter conversations that include emojis in the
response and assume the emojis convey the underlying emotions of the sentence.
We investigate several conditional variational autoencoders training on these
conversations, which allow us to use emojis to control the emotion of the
generated text. Experimentally, we show in our quantitative and qualitative
analyses that the proposed models can successfully generate high-quality
abstractive conversation responses in accordance with designated emotions.

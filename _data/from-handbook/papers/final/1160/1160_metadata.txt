Abstract#==#LocatedNear relation is a kind of commonsense knowledge describing two physical
objects that are typically found near each other in real life. In this paper, we
study how to automatically extract such relationship through a sentence-level relation classifier and aggregating the scores of entity pairs from a large corpus. Also, we release two benchmark datasets for evaluation and future research.

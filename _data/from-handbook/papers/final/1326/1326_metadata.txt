Abstract#==#Motivated by the positive impact of empty category on syntactic parsing, 
we study neural models for pre- and in-parsing detection of empty category,
which has not previously been investigated.
We find several non-obvious facts: 
  (a) BiLSTM can capture non-local contextual information which is essential
for detecting empty categories,
  (b) even with a BiLSTM, syntactic information is still able to enhance the
detection, and
  (c) automatic detection of empty categories improves parsing quality for
overt words.
Our neural ECD models outperform the prior state-of-the-art by significant
margins.

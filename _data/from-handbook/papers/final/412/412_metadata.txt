Abstract#==#We show that an epsilon-free, chain-free synchronous context-free grammar
(SCFG) can be converted into a weakly equivalent synchronous tree-adjoining
grammar (STAG) which is prefix lexicalized. This transformation at most doubles
the grammar's rank and cubes its size, but we show that in practice the size
increase is only quadratic. Our results extend Greibach normal form from CFGs
to SCFGs and prove new formal properties about SCFG, a formalism with many
applications in natural language processing.

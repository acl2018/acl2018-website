Abstract#==#In neural machine translation, a source sequence of words is encoded into a
vector from which a target sequence is generated in the decoding phase.
Differently from statistical machine translation, the associations between
source words and their possible target counterparts are not explicitly stored.
Source and target words are at the two ends of a long information processing
procedure, mediated by hidden states at both the source encoding and the target
decoding phases. This makes it possible that a source word is incorrectly
translated into a target word that is not any of its admissible equivalent
counterparts in the target language. 
In this paper, we seek to somewhat shorten the distance between source and
target words in that procedure, and thus strengthen their association, by means
of a method we term bridging source and target word embeddings. We experiment
with three strategies: (1) a source-side bridging model, where source word
embeddings are moved one step closer to the output target sequence; (2) a
target-side bridging model, which explores the more relevant source word
embeddings for the prediction of the target sequence; and (3) a direct bridging
model, which directly connects source and target word embeddings seeking to
minimize errors in the translation of ones by the others. 
Experiments and analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed
bridging models are able to significantly improve quality of both sentence
translation, in general, and alignment and translation of individual source
words with target words, in particular.

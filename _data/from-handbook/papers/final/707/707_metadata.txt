Abstract#==#Word embedding models such as GloVe rely on co-occurrence statistics to learn
vector representations of word meaning. While we may similarly expect that
co-occurrence statistics can be used to capture rich information about the
relationships between different words, existing approaches for modeling such
relationships are based on manipulating pre-trained word vectors. In this
paper, we introduce a novel method which directly learns relation vectors from
co-occurrence statistics. To this end, we first introduce a variant of GloVe,
in which there is an explicit connection between word vectors and PMI weighted
co-occurrence vectors. We then show how relation vectors can be naturally
embedded into the resulting vector space.

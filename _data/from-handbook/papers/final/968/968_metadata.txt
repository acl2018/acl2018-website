Abstract#==#While large-scale knowledge graphs provide vast amounts of structured facts
about entities, a short textual description can often be useful to succinctly
characterize an entity and its type. Unfortunately, many knowledge graphs
entities lack such textual descriptions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic
memory-based network that generates a short open vocabulary description of an
entity by jointly leveraging induced fact embeddings as well as the dynamic
context of the generated sequence of words. We demonstrate the ability of our
architecture to discern relevant information for more accurate generation of
type description by pitting the system against several strong baselines.

Abstract#==#We report an empirical study on the task of negation scope extraction given the
negation cue.
Our key observation is that certain useful information such as features related
to negation cue, long-distance dependencies as well as some latent structural
information can be exploited for such a task.
We design approaches based on conditional random fields (CRF), semi-Markov CRF,
as well as latent-variable CRF models to capture such information.
Extensive experiments on several standard datasets demonstrate that our
approaches are able to achieve better results than existing approaches reported
in the literature.

Abstract#==#News related content has been extensively studied in both topic modeling
research and named entity recognition. However, expressive power of named
entities and their potential for improving the quality of discovered topics has
not received much attention. In this paper we use named entities as
domain-specific terms for news-centric content and present a new weighting
model for Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Our experimental results indicate that
involving more named entities in topic descriptors positively influences the
overall quality of topics, improving their interpretability, specificity and
diversity.

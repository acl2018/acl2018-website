Abstract#==#Query auto-completion is a search engine feature whereby the system suggests
completed queries as the user types. Recently, the use of a recurrent neural
network language model was suggested as a method of generating query
completions. We show how an adaptable language model can be used to generate
personalized completions and how the model can use online updating to make
predictions for users not seen during training. The personalized predictions
are significantly better than a baseline that uses no user information.

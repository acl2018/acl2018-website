Abstract#==#Visual language grounding is widely studied
in modern neural image captioning
systems, which typically adopts an
encoder-decoder framework consisting of
two principal components: a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for image
feature extraction and a recurrent neural
network (RNN) for language caption generation.
To study the robustness of language
grounding to adversarial perturbations
in machine vision and perception,
we propose Show-and-Fool, a novel algorithm
for crafting adversarial examples
in neural image captioning. The proposed
algorithm provides two evaluation
approaches, which check if we can mislead
neural image captioning systems to
output some randomly chosen captions
or keywords. Our extensive experiments
show that our algorithm can successfully
craft visually-similar adversarial examples
with randomly targeted captions or keywords,
and the adversarial examples can
be made highly transferable to other image
captioning systems. Consequently, our approach
leads to new robustness implications
of neural image captioning and novel
insights in visual language grounding.

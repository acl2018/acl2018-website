Abstract#==#In this paper we present the Exemplar Encoder-Decoder network (EED), a novel
conversation model that learns to utilize \textit{similar} examples from
training data to generate responses. Similar conversation examples
(context-response pairs) from training data are retrieved using a traditional
TF-IDF based retrieval model and the corresponding responses are used by our
decoder to generate the ground truth response. The contribution of each
retrieved response is weighed by the similarity of corresponding context with
the input context. As a result, our model learns to assign higher similarity
scores to those retrieved contexts whose responses are crucial for generating
the final response. 
We present detailed experiments on two large data sets and we find that our
method out-performs state of the art sequence to sequence generative models on
several recently proposed evaluation metrics.

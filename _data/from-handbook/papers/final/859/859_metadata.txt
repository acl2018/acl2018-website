Abstract#==#We empirically investigate learning from partial feedback in neural machine translation
(NMT), when partial feedback is collected by asking users to highlight a correct
chunk of a translation. We propose a simple and effective way of utilizing such
feedback in NMT training. We demonstrate how the common machine translation
problem of domain mismatch between training and deployment can be reduced
solely based on chunk-level user feedback. We conduct a series of simulation
experiments to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our results show that chunk-level feedback outperforms sentence based feedback by up to 2.61% BLEU absolute.

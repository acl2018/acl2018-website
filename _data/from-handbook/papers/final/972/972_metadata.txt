Abstract#==#Intelligent systems require common sense, but automatically extracting this
knowledge from text can be difficult.  We propose and assess methods for
extracting one type of commonsense knowledge, object-property comparisons,
from pre-trained embeddings.  In experiments, we show that our approach exceeds
the accuracy of previous work but requires substantially less hand-annotated
knowledge.  Further, we show that an active learning approach that synthesizes
common-sense queries can boost accuracy.

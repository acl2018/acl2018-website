Abstract#==#Multi-choice reading comprehension is a challenging task, which involves the
matching between a passage and a question-answer pair. This paper proposes a
new co-matching approach to this problem, which jointly models whether a
passage can match both a question and a candidate answer. Experimental results
on the RACE dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract#==#We propose an efficient method to generate white-box  adversarial examples to trick a character-level neural classifier. We find that only a few manipulations are needed to greatly decrease the accuracy. 
 Our method relies on an atomic flip operation, which swaps one token for another, based on the gradients of the one-hot input vectors.
Due to efficiency of our method, we can perform adversarial training which makes the model more robust to attacks at test time. 
With the use of a few semantics-preserving constraints, we demonstrate that HotFlip can be adapted to attack a word-level classifier as well.

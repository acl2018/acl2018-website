Abstract#==#In the era of big data, focused analysis for diverse topics with a short
response time becomes an urgent demand. As a fundamental task, information
filtering therefore becomes a critical necessity. In this paper, we propose a
novel deep relevance model for zero-shot document filtering, named DAZER. DAZER
estimates the relevance between a document and a category by taking a small set
of seed words relevant to the category. With pre-trained word embeddings from a
large external corpus, DAZER is devised to extract the relevance signals by
modeling the hidden feature interactions in the word embedding space. The
relevance signals are extracted through a gated convolutional process. The gate
mechanism controls which convolution filters output the relevance signals in a
category dependent manner. Experiments on two document collections of two
different tasks (i.e., topic categorization and sentiment analysis) demonstrate
that DAZER significantly outperforms the existing alternative solutions,
including the state-of-the-art deep relevance ranking models.

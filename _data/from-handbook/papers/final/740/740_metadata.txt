Abstract#==#In this work, we study the credit assignment problem in reward augmented
maximum likelihood (RAML) learning, and establish a theoretical equivalence
between the token-level counterpart of RAML and the entropy regularized
reinforcement learning. Inspired by the connection, we propose two sequence
prediction algorithms, one extending RAML with fine-grained credit assignment
and the other improving Actor-Critic with a systematic entropy regularization.
On two benchmark datasets, we show the proposed algorithms outperform RAML and
Actor-Critic respectively, providing new alternatives to sequence prediction.

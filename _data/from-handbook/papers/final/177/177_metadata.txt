Abstract#==#This paper proposes hybrid semi-Markov conditional random fields (SCRFs) for
neural sequence labeling in natural language processing. Based on conventional
conditional random fields (CRFs), SCRFs have been designed for the tasks of
assigning labels to segments by extracting features from and describing
transitions between segments instead of words. In this paper, we improve the
existing SCRF methods by employing word-level and segment-level information
simultaneously. First, word-level labels are utilized to derive the segment
scores in SCRFs. Second, a CRF output layer and an SCRF output layer are
integrated into a unified neural network and trained jointly. Experimental
results on CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition (NER) shared task show that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance when no external knowledge is used.

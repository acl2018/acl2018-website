Abstract#==#We present the Supervised Directional Similarity Network, a novel neural
architecture for learning task-specific transformation functions on top of
general-purpose word embeddings. Relying on only a limited amount of
supervision from task-specific scores on a subset of the vocabulary, our
architecture is able to generalise and transform a general-purpose
distributional vector space to model the relation of lexical entailment.
Experiments show excellent performance on scoring graded lexical entailment,
raising the state-of-the-art on the HyperLex dataset by approximately 25%.

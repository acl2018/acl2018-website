Abstract#==#The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) provides a hierarchy of
diagnostic codes for classifying diseases. Medical coding -- which assigns a
subset of ICD codes to a patient visit -- is a mandatory process that is
crucial for patient care and billing. Manual coding is time-consuming,
expensive, and error prone. In this paper, we build a neural architecture for
automated coding. It takes the diagnosis descriptions (DDs) of a patient as
inputs and selects the most relevant ICD codes. This architecture contains four
major ingredients: (1) tree-of-sequences LSTM encoding of code descriptions
(CDs), (2) adversarial learning for reconciling the different writing styles of
DDs and CDs, (3) isotonic constraints for incorporating the importance order
among the assigned codes, and (4) attentional matching for performing
many-to-one and one-to-many mappings from DDs to CDs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods on a clinical datasets with 59K patient
visits.

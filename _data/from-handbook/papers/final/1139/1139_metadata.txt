Abstract#==#Inspired by the double temporality characteristic of narrative texts, we
propose a novel approach for acquiring rich temporal ``before/after'' event
knowledge across sentences in narrative stories. The double temporality states
that a narrative story often describes a sequence of events following the
chronological order and therefore, the temporal order of events matches with
their textual order. 
We explored narratology principles and built a weakly supervised approach that
identifies 287k narrative paragraphs from three large corpora. 
We then extracted rich temporal event knowledge from these narrative
paragraphs. Such event knowledge is shown useful to improve temporal relation
classification and outperforms several recent neural network models on the
narrative cloze task.

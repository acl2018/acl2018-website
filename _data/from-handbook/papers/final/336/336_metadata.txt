Abstract#==#Document-level information is very important for event detection even at
sentence level. In this paper, we propose a novel Document Embedding Enhanced
Bi-RNN model, called DEEB-RNN, to detect events in sentences. This model first
learns event detection oriented embeddings of documents through a hierarchical
and supervised attention based RNN, which pays word-level attention to event
triggers and sentence-level attention to those sentences containing events. It
then uses the learned document embedding to enhance another bidirectional RNN
model to identify event triggers and their types in sentences. Through
experiments on the ACE-2005 dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
merits of the proposed DEEB-RNN model via comparison with state-of-the-art
methods.

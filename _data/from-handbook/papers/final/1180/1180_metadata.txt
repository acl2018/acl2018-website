Abstract#==#Predicting how Congressional legislators will vote is important for
understanding their past and future behavior. However, previous work on
roll-call prediction has been limited to single session settings, thus not
allowing for generalization across sessions. In this paper, we show that text
alone is insufficient for modeling voting outcomes in new contexts, as session
changes lead to changes in the underlying data generation process. We propose a
novel neural method for encoding documents alongside additional metadata,
achieving an average of a 4% boost in accuracy over the previous
state-of-the-art.

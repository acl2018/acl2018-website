Abstract#==#We present a generative probabilistic model of documents as sequences of
sentences, and show that inference in it can lead to extraction of long-range
latent discourse structure from a collection of documents. The approach is
based on embedding sequences of sentences from longer texts into a 2- or 3-D
spatial grids, in which one or two coordinates model smooth topic transitions,
while the third captures the sequential nature of the modeled text. A
significant advantage of our approach is that the learned models are naturally
visualizable and interpretable, as semantic similarity and sequential structure
are modeled along orthogonal directions in the grid. We show that the method is
effective in capturing discourse structures in narrative    text across
multiple genres, including biographies, stories, and newswire reports. In
particular, our method outperforms or is competitive with state-of-the-art
generative approaches on tasks such as predicting the outcome of a story, and
sentence ordering.

Abstract#==#The prevalent use of too few references for evaluating text-to-text generation
is known to bias estimates of their quality (henceforth, low coverage bias or
LCB). This paper shows that overcoming LCB in Grammatical Error Correction
(GEC) evaluation cannot be attained by re-scaling or by increasing the number
of references in any feasible range, contrary to previous suggestions. This is
due to the long-tailed distribution of valid corrections for a sentence.
Concretely, we show that LCB incentivizes GEC systems to avoid correcting even
when they can generate a valid correction. Consequently, existing systems
obtain comparable or superior performance compared to humans, by making few but
targeted changes to the input. Similar effects on Text Simplification further
support our claims.

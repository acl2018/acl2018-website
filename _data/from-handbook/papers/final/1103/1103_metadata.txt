Abstract#==#Research on distributed word representations is focused on widely-used
languages such as English. Although the same methods can be used for other
languages, language-specific knowledge can enhance the accuracy and richness of
word vector representations. In this paper, we look at improving distributed
word representations for Korean using knowledge about the unique linguistic
structure of Korean. Specifically, we decompose Korean words into the
jamo-level, beyond the character-level, allowing a systematic use of subword
information.
To evaluate the vectors, we develop Korean test sets for word similarity and
analogy and make them publicly available. The results show that our simple
method outperforms word2vec and character-level Skip-Grams on semantic and
syntactic similarity and analogy tasks and contributes positively toward
downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis.

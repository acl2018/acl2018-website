Abstract#==#Analyzing human multimodal language is an emerging area of research in NLP.
Intrinsically this language is multimodal (heterogeneous), sequential and
asynchronous; it consists of the language (words), visual (expressions) and
acoustic (paralinguistic) modalities all in the form of asynchronous
coordinated sequences. From a resource perspective, there is a genuine need for
large scale datasets that allow for in-depth studies of this form of language.
In this paper we introduce CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity
(CMU-MOSEI), the largest dataset of sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to
date. Using data from CMU-MOSEI and a novel multimodal fusion technique called the
Dynamic Fusion Graph (DFG), we conduct experimentation to exploit how
modalities interact with each other in human multimodal language. Unlike
previously proposed fusion techniques, DFG is highly interpretable and achieves
competative performance when compared to the previous state of the art.

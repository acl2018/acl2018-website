Abstract#==#Traditionally, Referring Expression Generation (REG) models first decide on the
form and then on the content of references to discourse entities in text,
typically relying on features such as salience and grammatical function. In
this paper, we present a new approach (NeuralREG), relying on deep neural
networks, which makes decisions about form and content in one go without
explicit feature extraction. Using a delexicalized version of the WebNLG
corpus, we show that the neural model substantially improves over two strong
baselines.

Abstract#==#Because obtaining training data is often the most difficult part of an NLP or
ML project, we develop methods for predicting how much data is required to
achieve a desired test accuracy by extrapolating results from models trained on
a small pilot training dataset.  We model how accuracy varies as a function of
training size on subsets of the pilot data, and use that model to predict how
much training data would be required to achieve the desired accuracy.  

We introduce a new performance extrapolation task to evaluate how well
different extrapolations predict accuracy on larger training sets. We show that
details of hyperparameter optimisation and the extrapolation models can have
dramatic effects in a document classification task.  We believe this is an
important first step in developing methods for estimating the resources
required to meet specific engineering performance targets.

Abstract#==#Target-oriented sentiment classification aims at classifying sentiment
polarities over individual opinion targets in a sentence. RNN with attention
seems a good fit for the characteristics of this task, and indeed it achieves
the state-of-the-art performance. After re-examining the drawbacks of attention
mechanism and the obstacles that block CNN to perform well in this
classification task, we propose a new model that achieves new state-of-the-art
results on a few benchmarks. Instead of attention, our model employs a CNN
layer to extract salient features from the transformed word representations
originated from a bi-directional RNN layer. Between the two layers, we propose
a component which first generates target-specific representations of words in
the sentence, and then incorporates a mechanism for preserving the original
contextual information from the RNN layer.

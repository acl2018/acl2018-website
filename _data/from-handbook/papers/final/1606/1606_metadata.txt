Abstract#==#Predicate argument structure analysis is a task of identifying
 structured events. To improve this field, we need to identify a salient
 entity, which cannot be identified without performing coreference
 resolution and predicate argument structure analysis
 simultaneously. This paper presents an entity-centric joint model for
 Japanese coreference resolution and predicate argument structure
 analysis. Each entity is assigned an embedding, and when the result of
 both analyses refers to an entity, the entity embedding is updated. The
 analyses take the entity embedding into consideration to access
 the global information of entities. Our experimental results
 demonstrate the proposed method can improve the performance of the
 inter-sentential zero anaphora resolution drastically, which is a
 notoriously difficult task in predicate argument structure analysis.

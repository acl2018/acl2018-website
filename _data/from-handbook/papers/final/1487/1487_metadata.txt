Abstract#==#State-of-the-art knowledge base completion (KBC) models predict a score for
every known or unknown fact via a latent factorization over entity and relation
embeddings. We observe that when they fail, they often make entity predictions
that are incompatible with the type required by the relation. In response, we
enhance each base factorization with two type-compatibility terms between
entity-relation pairs, and combine the signals in a novel manner. Without
explicit supervision from a type catalog, our proposed modification obtains up
to 7% MRR gains over base models, and new state-of-the-art results on several
datasets.  Further analysis reveals that our models better represent the latent
types of entities and their embeddings also predict supervised types better
than the embeddings fitted by baseline models.

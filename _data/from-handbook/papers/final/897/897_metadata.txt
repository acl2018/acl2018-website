Abstract#==#We propose a multi-lingual multi-task architecture to develop supervised models
with a minimal amount of labeled data for sequence labeling.
In this new architecture, we combine various transfer models using two layers
of parameter sharing. On the first layer, we construct the  basis of the
architecture to provide universal word representation and feature extraction
capability for all models. On the second level, we adopt different parameter
sharing strategies for different transfer schemes.
This architecture proves to be particularly effective for low-resource
settings, when there are less than 200 training sentences for the target task.
Using Name Tagging as a target task, our approach achieved 4.3%-50.5% absolute
F-score gains compared to the mono-lingual single-task baseline model.

Abstract#==#In conversation, a general response (e.g., ''I don't know'') could correspond
to a large variety of input utterances. Previous generative conversational
models usually employ a single model to learn the relationship between
different utterance-response pairs, thus tend to favor general and trivial
responses which appear frequently. To address this problem, we propose a novel
controlled response generation mechanism to handle different utterance-response
relationships in terms of specificity. Specifically, we introduce an explicit
specificity control variable into a sequence-to-sequence model, which interacts
with the usage representation of words through a Gaussian Kernel layer, to
guide the model to generate responses at different specificity levels. We
describe two ways to acquire distant labels for the specificity control
variable in learning. Empirical studies show that our model can significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art response generation models under both automatic
and human evaluations.

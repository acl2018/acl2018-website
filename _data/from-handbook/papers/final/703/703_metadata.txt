Abstract#==#Statistical significance testing is a standard statistical
tool designed to ensure that experimental
results are not coincidental. In this opinion/
theoretical paper we discuss the role of statistical
significance testing in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) research. We establish the fundamental
concepts of significance testing and discuss
the specific aspects of NLP tasks, experimental setups
and evaluation measures that affect the choice
of significance tests in NLP research. Based on
this discussion we propose a simple practical protocol
for statistical significance test selection in
NLP setups and accompany this protocol with a
brief survey of the most relevant tests. We then
survey recent empirical papers published in ACL
and TACL during 2017 and show that while our
community assigns great value to experimental results,
statistical significance testing is often ignored
or misused. We conclude with a brief discussion
of open issues that should be properly addressed
so that this important tool can be applied.
in NLP research in a statistically sound manner.

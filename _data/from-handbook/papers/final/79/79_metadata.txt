Abstract#==#Neural Machine Translation (NMT) performs poor on the low-resource language
pair (X,Z), especially when Z is a rare language. By introducing another rich
language Y, we propose a novel triangular training architecture (TA-NMT) to
leverage bilingual data (Y,Z) (may be small) and (X,Y) (can be rich) to improve
the translation performance of low-resource pairs. In this triangular
architecture, Z is taken as the intermediate latent variable, and translation
models of Z are jointly optimized with an unified bidirectional EM algorithm
under the goal of maximizing the translation likelihood of (X,Y). Empirical
results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the translation
quality of rare languages on MultiUN and IWSLT2012 datasets, and achieves even
better performance combining back-translation methods.

Abstract#==#Chit-chat models are known to have several problems: they lack specificity, do
not display a consistent personality and are often not very captivating. In
this work we present the task of  making chit-chat more engaging by
conditioning on profile information. We collect data and train models to
(i)condition on their given profile information; and (ii) information about the
person they are talking to, resulting in improved dialogues, as measured by
next utterance prediction. Since (ii) is initially unknown our model is trained
to engage its partner with personal topics, and we show the resulting dialogue
can be used to predict profile information about the interlocutors.

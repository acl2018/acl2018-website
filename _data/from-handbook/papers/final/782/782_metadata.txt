Abstract#==#Generic word embeddings are trained on large-scale generic corpora; Domain
Specific (DS) word embeddings are trained only on data from a domain of
interest. This paper proposes a method to combine the breadth of generic
embeddings with the specificity of domain specific embeddings. The resulting
embeddings, called Domain Adapted (DA) word embeddings, are formed by aligning
corresponding word vectors using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or the
related nonlinear Kernel CCA. 
Evaluation results on sentiment classification tasks show that the DA
embeddings substantially outperform both generic, DS embeddings when used as
input features to standard or state-of-the-art sentence encoding algorithms for
classification.

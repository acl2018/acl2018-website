Abstract#==#We introduce the new Multimodal Named Entity Disambiguation (MNED) task for
multimodal social media posts such as Snapchat or Instagram captions, which are
composed of short captions with accompanying images. Social media posts bring
significant challenges for disambiguation tasks because 1) ambiguity not only
comes from polysemous entities, but also from inconsistent or incomplete
notations, 2) very limited context is provided with surrounding words, and 3)
there are many emerging entities often unseen during training. To this end, we
build a new dataset called SnapCaptionsKB, a collection of Snapchat image
captions submitted to public and crowd-sourced stories, with named entity
mentions fully annotated and linked to entities in an external knowledge base.
We then build a deep zeroshot multimodal network for MNED that 1) extracts
contexts from both text and image, and 2) predicts correct entity in the
knowledge graph embeddings space, allowing for zeroshot disambiguation of
entities unseen in training set as well. The proposed model significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art text-only NED models, showing efficacy and
potentials of the MNED task.

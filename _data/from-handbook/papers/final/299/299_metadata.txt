Abstract#==#We propose Object-oriented Neural Programming (OONP), a framework for
semantically parsing documents in specific domains. Basically, OONP reads a
document and parses it into a predesigned object-oriented data structure that
reflects the domain-specific semantics of the document. An OONP parser models
semantic parsing as a decision process: a neural net-based Reader sequentially
goes through the document, and builds and updates an intermediate ontology
during the process to summarize its partial understanding of the text. OONP
supports a big variety of forms (both symbolic and differentiable) for
representing the state and the document, and a rich family of operations to
compose the representation. An OONP parser can be trained with supervision of
different forms and strength, including supervised learning (SL), reinforcement
learning (RL) and hybrid of the two. Our experiments on both synthetic and
real-world document parsing tasks have shown that OONP can learn to handle
fairly complicated ontology with training data of modest sizes.

Abstract#==#We present a corpus of 5,000 richly annotated abstracts of medical articles
describing clinical randomized controlled trials. Annotations include
demarcations of text spans that describe the Patient population enrolled, the
Interventions studied and to what they were Compared, and the Outcomes measured
(the `PICO' elements). These spans are further annotated at a more granular
level, e.g., individual interventions within them are marked and mapped onto a
structured medical vocabulary. We acquired annotations from a diverse set of
workers with varying levels of expertise and cost. We describe our data
collection process and the corpus itself in detail. We then outline a set of
challenging NLP tasks that would aid searching of the medical literature and
the practice of evidence-based medicine.

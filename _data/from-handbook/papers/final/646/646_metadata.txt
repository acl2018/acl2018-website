Abstract#==#The task of Question Answering is at the very core of machine comprehension. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for
text-based multiple choice question answering where questions are based on a
particular article. Given an article and a multiple choice question, our model
assigns a score to each question-option tuple and chooses the final option
accordingly. We test our model on Textbook Question Answering (TQA) and SciQ
dataset. Our model outperforms several LSTM-based baseline models on the two
datasets.

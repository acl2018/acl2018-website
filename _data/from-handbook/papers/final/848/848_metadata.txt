Abstract#==#State-of-the-art relation extraction approaches are only able to recognize
relationships between mentions of entity arguments stated explicitly in the
text and typically localized to  the same sentence. However, the vast majority
of relations are either implicit or not sententially localized. 
This is a major problem for Knowledge Base Population, severely limiting
recall. In this paper we propose a new methodology to identify relations
between two entities, consisting of detecting a very large number of unary
relations, and using them to infer missing entities. We describe a deep
learning architecture able to learn thousands of such relations very
efficiently by using a common deep learning based representation. Our approach
largely outperforms state of the art relation extraction technology on a newly
introduced web scale knowledge base population benchmark, that we release to
the research community.

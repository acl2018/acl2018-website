Abstract#==#Automatic pun generation is an interesting and challenging text generation
task. Previous efforts rely on templates or laboriously manually annotated
pun datasets, which heavily constrains the quality and diversity of
generated puns. Since sequence-to-sequence models provide an effective
technique for text generation, it is promising to investigate these
models on the pun generation task. In this paper, we propose neural
network models for homographic pun generation, and they can generate
puns without requiring any pun data for training. We first train a
conditional neural language model from a general text corpus, and
then generate puns from the language model with an elaborately designed
decoding algorithm. Automatic and human evaluations show that our
models are able to generate homographic puns of good readability and
quality.

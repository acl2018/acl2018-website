Abstract#==#In this work, we propose a novel constituency parsing scheme. The model first
predicts a real-valued scalar, named syntactic distance, for each split
position in the sentence. The topology of grammar tree is then determined by
the values of syntactic distances. Compared to traditional shift-reduce parsing
schemes, our approach is free from the potentially disastrous compounding
error. It is also easier to parallelize and much faster. Our model achieves the
state-of-the-art single model F1 score of 92.1 on PTB and 86.4 on CTB dataset,
which surpasses the previous single model results by a large margin.

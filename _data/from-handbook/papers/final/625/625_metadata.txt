Abstract#==#End-to-end task-oriented dialog systems usually suffer from the challenge of
incorporating knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a novel yet simple
end-to-end differentiable model called memory-to-sequence (Mem2Seq) to address
this issue. Mem2Seq is the first neural generative model that combines the
multi-hop attention over memories with the idea of pointer network. We
empirically show how Mem2Seq controls each generation step, and how its
multi-hop attention mechanism helps in learning correlations between memories.
In addition, our model is quite general without complicated task-specific
designs. As a result, we show that Mem2Seq can be trained faster and attain the
state-of-the-art performance on three different task-oriented dialog datasets.

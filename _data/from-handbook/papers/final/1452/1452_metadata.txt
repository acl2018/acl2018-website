Abstract#==#People go to different places to engage in activities that reflect their goals.
For example, people go to restaurants to eat, libraries to study, and churches
to pray. We refer to an activity that represents a common reason why people
typically go to a location as a prototypical goal activity (goal-act).  Our
research aims to learn goal-acts for specific locations using a text corpus and
semi-supervised learning. First, we extract activities and locations that
co-occur in goal-oriented syntactic patterns. Next, we create an activity
profile matrix and apply a semi-supervised label propagation algorithm to
iteratively revise the activity strengths for different locations using a
small set of labeled data. We show that this approach outperforms several
baseline methods when judged against goal-acts identified by human annotators.

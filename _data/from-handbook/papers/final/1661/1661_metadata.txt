Abstract#==#As the amount of free-form user-generated reviews in e-commerce websites
continues to increase, there is an increasing need for automatic mechanisms
that sift through the vast amounts of user reviews and identify quality
content. Review helpfulness modeling is a task which studies the mechanisms
that affect review helpfulness and attempts to accurately predict it. This
paper provides an overview of the most relevant work in helpfulness prediction
and understanding in the past decade, discusses the insights gained from said
work, and provides guidelines for future research.

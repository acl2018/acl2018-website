Abstract#==#We propose an entity-centric neural crosslingual coreference model that builds
on multi-lingual embeddings and language independent features. We perform both
intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of our model. In the intrinsic evaluation,
we show that our model, when trained on English and tested on Chinese and
Spanish,
achieves competitive results to the models trained directly on Chinese and
Spanish respectively. In the extrinsic evaluation, we show that our English
model
helps achieve superior entity linking accuracy on Chinese and Spanish test sets
than the top 2015 TAC system without using any annotated data from Chinese or
Spanish.

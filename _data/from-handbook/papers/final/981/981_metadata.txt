Abstract#==#Recent embedding-based methods in bilingual lexicon induction show good
results, but do not take advantage of orthographic features, such as edit
distance, which can be helpful for pairs of related languages. This work
extends embedding-based methods to incorporate these features, resulting in
significant accuracy gains for related languages.

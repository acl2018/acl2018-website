Abstract#==#Coreference resolution aims to identify in a text all mentions that refer to
the same real world entity.
The state-of-the-art end-to-end neural coreference model considers all text
spans in a document as potential mentions and learns to link an antecedent for
each possible mention.
In this paper, we propose to improve the end-to-end coreference resolution
system by (1) using a biaffine attention model to get antecedent scores for
each possible mention, and (2) jointly optimizing the mention detection
accuracy and mention clustering accuracy given the mention cluster labels.
Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL-2012 shared
task English test set.

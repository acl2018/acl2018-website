Abstract#==#Neural vector representations are ubiquitous throughout all subfields of NLP.
While word vectors have been studied in much detail, thus far only little light
has been shed on the properties of sentence embeddings. In this paper, we
assess to what extent prominent sentence embedding methods exhibit select
semantic properties. We propose a framework that generate triplets of sentences
to explore how changes in the syntactic structure or semantics of a given
sentence affect the similarities obtained between their sentence embeddings.

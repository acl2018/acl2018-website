Abstract#==#Text in many domains involves a significant amount of named entities.
Predicting the entity names is often challenging for a language model as they
appear less frequent on the training corpus. In this paper, we propose a novel
and effective approach to building a language model which can learn the entity
names by leveraging their entity type information. We also introduce two
benchmark datasets based on recipes and Java programming codes, on which we
evaluate the proposed model. Experimental results show that our model achieves
52.2\% better perplexity in recipe generation and 22.06\% on code generation
than state-of-the-art language models.

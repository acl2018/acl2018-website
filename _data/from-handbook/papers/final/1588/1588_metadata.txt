Abstract#==#While syntactic dependency annotations
concentrate on the surface or functional
structure of a sentence, semantic depen-
dency annotations aim to capture between-
word relationships that are more closely
related to the meaning of a sentence, using
graph-structured representations. We ex-
tend the LSTM-based syntactic parser of
Dozat and Manning (2017) to train on and
generate these graph structures. The re-
sulting system on its own achieves state-
of-the-art performance, beating the pre-
vious, substantially more complex state-
of-the-art system by 0.6% labeled F1.
Adding linguistically richer input repre-
sentations pushes the margin even higher,
allowing us to beat it by 1.9% labeled F1.

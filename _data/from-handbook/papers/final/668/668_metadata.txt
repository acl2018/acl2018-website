Abstract#==#Entity linking involves aligning textual mentions of named entities to their
corresponding entries in a knowledge base. Entity linking systems often exploit
relations between textual mentions in a document (e.g., coreference) to decide
if the linking decisions are compatible. Unlike previous approaches, which
relied on supervised systems or heuristics to predict these relations, we treat
relations as latent variables in our neural entity-linking model. We induce the
relations without any supervision while optimizing the entity-linking system in
an end-to-end fashion. Our multi-relational model achieves the best reported
scores on the standard benchmark (AIDA-CoNLL) and substantially outperforms its
relation-agnostic version. Its training also converges much faster, suggesting
that the injected structural bias helps to explain regularities in the training
data.

Abstract#==#We present NovelPerspective: a tool to allow consumers to subset their digital literature, based on point of view (POV) character.
Many novels have multiple main characters each with their own storyline running in parallel.
A well-known example is George R. R. Martin's  novel: ``A Game of Thrones'', and others from that series.
Our tool detects the main character that each section is from the POV of,
and allows the user to generate a new ebook with only those sections.
This gives consumers new options in how they consume their media; allowing them to  pursue the storylines sequentially, or skip chapters about characters they find boring.
We present two heuristic-based baselines, and two machine learning based methods for the detection of the main character.

Abstract#==#The open-source SUMMA Platform is a highly scalable distributed
architecture for monitoring a large number of media broadcasts in
parallel, with a lag behind actual broadcast time of at most a few
minutes.

The Platform offers a fully automated media ingestion pipeline capable
of recording live broadcasts, detection and transcription of spoken
content, translation of all text (original or transcribed) into
English, recognition and linking of Named Entities, topic detection, clustering
and cross-lingual multi-document summarization of related media items,
and last but not least, extraction and storage of factual claims in
these news items. Browser-based graphical user interfaces provide
humans with aggregated information as well as structured access to
individual news items stored in the Platform's database.

This paper describes the intended use cases and provides an overview
over the system's implementation.

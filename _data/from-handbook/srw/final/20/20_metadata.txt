Abstract#==#The word order between source and target languages significantly influences the translation quality. Preordering can effectively address this problem.　Previous preordering methods require a manual feature design, making language dependent design difficult.　In this paper, we propose a preordering method with recursive neural networks that learn features from raw inputs. Experiments show the proposed method is comparable to the state-of-the-art method but without a manual feature design.

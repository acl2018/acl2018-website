title: ACL 2018 Quantitative Analyses
snippet: Quantitative analyses of submissions are available
---

The ACL 2018 programme chairs performed some quantitative analyses on the
submissions, to obtain some insights into the accepted papers and the
research trends of ACL 2018.

First, we analyse the correlation of the overall score with some review
variables. The top three variables are substance, soundness and
originality. There is a negative correlation with the reviewer
confidence, though not very high. This negative correlation is because
many rejected papers receive low overall scores but high confidence.

The next figure shows the distribution of the overall review scores
among the accepted/blue and rejected/red papers. Most of the accepted
papers have received scores of 4 and 5, while there were a significant
number of rejected papers among those with the score of 4 and even some
with the score of 5.

The next figure presents the distribution of the Originality scores. We
find that it is roughly the same number of papers with the score of 3
being accepted or rejected. For the score of 4, around two-thirds get
accepted and the remaining one-third are rejected. Most of the rejected
papers have low originality.

The next figure presents the distribution of the Readability scores. We
cannot see much difference for accepted and rejected papers in terms of
their readability scores.

Next, we present some word cloud based analyses. We use the [Venncloud](https://github.com/Coppersmith/vennclouds) to generate the
comparison word clouds. We first looked into the words in the titles of
the accepted and rejected papers in ACL2018. The left/blue column
presents the words that appear often in the accepted papers but not very
often in the rejected papers, the right/red column presents the words
that appear often in the rejected papers but not very often in the
accepted papers, and the middle/black column presents the words that
appear often in both accepted and rejected papers.

Finally, we compare the words in the titles of the accepted papers of
ACL2017 and ACL2018 in the next figure. We find attention, network,
knowledge, sequence and language are popular in both 17 and 18. In
addition, we find sentence, embeddings and sentiment are not so popular
in 2017 but becomes more prominent in 2018.

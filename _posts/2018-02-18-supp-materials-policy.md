We have now [clarified]({{ github.site.url }}/call-for-papers/#supplementary-material) in the call for papers
that suppplementary materials should be included in a separate file, not 
the appendix section of the main paper (and do not count towards the page limit). There is a separate field in the submission form where submitters can attach the supplementary materials.

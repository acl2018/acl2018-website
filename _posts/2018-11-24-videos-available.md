The majority of oral presentations at ACL were recorded and are now available from [the ACL Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/aclweb). Talks are also linked from the [paper listing](/programme/papers/) and [schedule](/programme/schedule/) â€“ click on the "<i class="fas fa-video"></i>" icon to search for the talk on Vimeo (in some cases posters will show these links but not show any search results on Vimeo).

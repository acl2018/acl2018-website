The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), and the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) invite proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with ACL 2018, COLING 2018, EMNLP 2018, or NAACL 2018. We seek proposals for tutorials in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines such as linguistics, speech, information retrieval and multimodal processing. We particularly welcome:

1. tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any ACL/COLING/EMNLP/NAACL related tutorial, or
2. tutorials that provide introductions into related fields that are potentially relevant for the CL community (e.g., bioinformatics, social media, human language processing, machine learning techniques). 

Tutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues:

* [ACL 2018](http://acl2018.org/) is the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. It will be held in Melbourne, Australia on July 15–20, 2018. The ACL tutorials will be held on July 15th.
* [COLING 2018](http://coling2018.org/) is the 27th Biennial International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING). It will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA on August 20-25, 2018. The COLING tutorials will be held on August 20-21. 
* EMNLP 2018 is the SIGDAT conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). EMNLP will be held later in 2018 (after the other three conferences). Exact details on dates and venue for EMNLP tutorials will be announced soon.
* [NAACL 2018](http://naacl2018.org/) is the 16th Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL). It will be held in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, June 1-6, 2018. The NAACL tutorials will be held on June 1.


### Remuneration

Information on the payment for tutorial instructors can be found in the [Tutorial Teacher Payment Policy](http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Tutorial_teacher_payment_policy) 

*Please note: remuneration for tutorial presenters is fixed according to the above policy and does not cover registration fees for the main conference.*

### Submission Details

Proposals should be submitted as PDF documents. Proposals should contain:

1. A title and brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the CL community (not more than 2 pages).

2. A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the tutorial’s core content can be covered in a three-hour slot (including a coffee break). In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are available as well.

3. The names, affiliations, email addresses and websites of the tutorial instructors, including a one-paragraph statement of their research interests and areas of expertise.

4. Please provide an estimate of the audience size for the tutorial. If  the same or a similar tutorial has been given before, a note specifying where previous versions of the tutorial were given, how many attendees were there, and how many attendees the tutorial attracted. 

5. A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g., internet access).

6. A note specifying which venue(s) (ACL/COLING/EMNLP/NAACL) would be acceptable and/or preferable. Please include a description of any constraints that might make the tutorial compatible with only one of these events, logistically, thematically, or otherwise. 

Tutorial proposals should be [submitted online using the START system](https://www.softconf.com/i/cl-tutorials2018)

Proposals will be reviewed jointly by the Tutorial Co-Chairs of the four conferences.

### Tutorial Speaker Responsibilities

Accepted tutorial speakers will be notified by February 1, 2018. They must then provide abstracts of their tutorials for inclusion in the conference registration material by the specific conference deadlines. The description should be in two formats: an ASCII version that can be included in email announcements and published on the conference website, and a PDF version for inclusion in the electronic proceedings (detailed instructions will be provided). Tutorial speakers must provide tutorial materials, at least containing copies of the course slides as well as a bibliography for the material covered in the tutorial, by the deadlines specified for the four conferences, to be determined later.

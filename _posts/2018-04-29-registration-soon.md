We know that you are all excited to join us at ACL2018 and are hoping to register soon! ACL will welcome registration from anyone who is interested, whether or not you are presenting a paper at the conference.

Work is underway to finalise the registration pages, but due to factors beyond the control of the organising committee, the registration site is not yet available. We ask you for your patience and will have it open soon – it will of course be announced here when it opens.

In the meantime, you can already book your [accommodation]({{ site.github.url }}/attendees/accommodation).

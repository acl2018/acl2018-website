Help us recruit the best area chairs, reviewers, and invited 
speakers!

We are soliciting nominations for ACL 2018 in three categories: Area 
Chairs, Reviewers, and Invited Speakers. Similarly to ACL 2017, we 
approach it bottom-up in order to find the best candidates from our 
research community to ensure broad coverage of expertise in all areas of 
NLP.

Each of the nomination sections is optional so you can skip it if you 
have no preferences.

### Area Chair nominations

*Maximum of 3 nominees*

Self nominations are welcomed and encouraged. You will have to answer 
why you think your nominee is qualified to review for her/his area of 
expertise related to automated language processing. As a minimum 
requirement, nominated ACs must have a Ph.D. in an area related to 
NLP/CL and have published prior work in an NLP/CL venue.

### Reviewers

*Maximum of 4 nominees*

We want to increase the quality of the reviewing process as much as 
possible. Self nominations are welcomed and encouraged. As a minimum 
requirement, nominated reviewers must have a good publication record in 
NLP/CL and past experiences in reviewing for ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/*CL 
conferences. Apart from that, the most important factors are reliability 
and willingness to keep the community's high scientific standards.

### Invited Speakers

*Maximum of 3 nominees*

It is expected that the Invited Speaker is not only an exceptional 
researcher but also a community influencer and someone who can deliver a 
motivating talk. Nominations from outside the mainstream NLP/CL 
community are also welcome!

Filling in [the form][nomform] will only take about 5 to 10 minutes; you help will be 
much appreciated before *September 30, 2017*.

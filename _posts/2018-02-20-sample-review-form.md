For paper reviewers, we have now made a [sample review form]({{ site.github.url }}/downloads/acl_2018_review_form.html) available which you can use to see the reviewing requirements in advance without logging into Softconf. Note that the `Submit` button is disabled, and that you cannot use this to submit your actual reviews, which will be done through [START Conference Manager](https://www.softconf.com/acl2018/papers/).

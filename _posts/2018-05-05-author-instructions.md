Daniele Pighin and Yuval Marton.)

### When and where do I send my final camera-ready paper?

The deadline is May 11, 2018 (at 11:59pm, UTC-12 hours). You may submit
the final version of your paper by navigating to the [ACL 2018 START
login](https://www.softconf.com/acl2018/papers/) and following the
internal links.

### How should the final copy differ from the original submission? 

The camera-ready version of your paper should incorporate the comments
of the reviewers as well as other changes you see fit to make. In
addition, be sure to do all of the following:

-   Ensure that your paper conforms to the [provided styles, font and
    page size](http://acl2018.org/call-for-papers/).

-   Include the authors\' names and affiliations under the title.

-   De-anonymize references to your own work in the body of the paper.

-   Where appropriate, add acknowledgments for colleagues, reviewers,
    and grants. Please note that the acknowledgement section should
    fit within the allowed page boundaries (9 pages of content for
    long papers, 5 pages of content for short papers) and be in the
    same font as the rest of the paper.

-   Ensure that all tables, graphs, and figures are readable when viewed
    in black and white.

### How long can it be? 

For both long and short papers, we allow one extra page of content and
unlimited reference pages to help address reviewer comments.

Long papers are permitted at most 9 pages of text and unlimited pages
containing only references. Short papers get 5 pages of text plus
unlimited pages for references.

You may also provide a supplementary material file, which is separate
from the rest of the paper. For more details, see
[the call for papers](http://acl2018.org/call-for-papers/#supplementary-material).

### What is the format for the camera-ready copy?

The file must be in Portable Document Format (PDF) on A4 paper. We
require the     use of [ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files
tailored for this year\'s ACL
conference](http://acl2018.org/call-for-papers/). You can
view the style files and detailed formatting instructions on the web.

If you are using LaTeX, please create the PDF file with pdflatex or
xelatex. This ensures use of the proper Type 1 fonts and also takes
advantage of other PDF features. You will have the best results using a
modern LaTeX distribution, in particular, [TeX
live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/). Using the geometry
package to set the A4 format is recommended.

### What if my paper includes graphics?

Remember that you are providing a camera-ready copy. Thus, artwork and
photos should be included directly in the paper in their final
positions. Ideally, you should use vector graphic formats (PDF, EPS),
which allow the graphics to scale arbitrarily. Avoid GIF or JPEG images
that are low resolution or highly compressed.

Your paper must look good both when printed (A4 size, black-and-white)
and when viewed on screen as PDF (zoomable to any size, color okay).
Thus, you may want to use color high-resolution graphics, allowing
readers to zoom in on a graph and study it. However, **please** check
that the same graph or photograph is legible when printed on a
black-and-white printer. For example, different lines in a graph should
not be distinguished only by color, although they can **also** be
distinguished by color.

A good test is to print the paper on your own black-and-white laser
printer, and to view it in a PDF viewer at different resolutions.

Don\'t go overboard on resolution; keep file sizes manageable. Note that
vector graphics (e.g., encapsulated PostScript) look good at any scale
and take up little space (unless you are plotting many thousands of data
points).

### What about copyright?

When you submit the paper, you will be asked to sign the **ACL Copyright Transfer Agreement** on behalf of all
authors, either electronically (via
the [START Conference
Manager](https://www.softconf.com/acl2018/papers/)) or
physically. Authors retain many rights under this agreement and it is
appropriate in the vast majority of cases. Please contact the
publication chairs Wei Lu, Kevin Gimpel and Shay Cohen with any concerns
regarding copyright.

Before signing this form, please confirm with your co-authors (and, if
applicable, your and their employers) that they authorize you to sign on
their behalf.

### What if my paper\'s title or author list has changed? 

We do not allow adding/deleting authors after the submission deadline.
Please note that your name will appear in conference metadata as you
have configured it in START, so make sure that it is correct there
(e.g., capitalization, full name, etc). You can change this on the [user
settings](https://www.softconf.com/acl2018/super/scmd.cgi?ucmd=updateProfile) page of the START conference manager, under \"User\" \>
\"Account Information\" \> \"Update Profile\". You can change the title
of the paper on the camera-ready submission site.

### My question isn\'t answered hereâ€¦ 

Please email the publication chairs, Wei Lu, Kevin Gimpel and Shay
Cohen.

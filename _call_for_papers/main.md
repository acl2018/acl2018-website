The ACL 2018 conference invites the submission of long and short papers
on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of
Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. As in recent
years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers
accepted by the Transactions of the ACL journal.

### Important Note

ACL 2018 adopts the [new policies for submission, review, and citation][new policies].  Submissions that violate any of these policies will be rejected without review.  Most importantly, the policies refer to the *anonymity period*, which starts at *January 22nd, 2018* for ACL 2018.

- You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available
  online to the general community (for example, via a preprint
  server) during the anonymity period.

- You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity
  period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take
  other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing
  during the anonymity period.

The details are described in the section [ACL Author Guidelines](#acl-author-guidelines). For the
background of the new policies, refer to the [online version][new policies].

### Long Papers

Long ACL 2018 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed
and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and
analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior
to the deadlines.

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus
unlimited references; final versions of long papers will be given one
additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers’ comments
can be taken into account.

Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the
program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented
orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature
rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the
proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.

### Short Papers

ACL 2018 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must
describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper
is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point
that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:

-   A small, focused contribution
-   Work in progress
-   A negative result
-   An opinion piece
-   An interesting application nugget

Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus
unlimited references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five
(5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this
additional page to address reviewers’ comments in their final versions.

Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions.
While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the
proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between
short papers presented orally and as posters.

### General Notes

Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not
available to the reviewers. Papers may be accompanied by a resource
(software and/or data) described in the paper. Papers that are submitted
with accompanying software/data may receive additional credit toward the
overall evaluation score, and the potential impact of the software and
data will be taken into account when making the acceptance/rejection
decisions.

#### Supplementary Material 

ACL 2018 also encourages the submission of supplementary material to
report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details
necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the paper.
Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a large
difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such decisions to
precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods.

Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather than
central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details of proofs
or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or
feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code
or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary
material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary
material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers,
they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary
material. Authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary
material in the paper submission, so that reviewers interested in these
supplementary details will know where to look.

**Note**: The supplementary material does not form part of the paper,
does not count towards page limit and should not be included in the 
"Appendix" section of the ACL template (despite the unfortunate wording).
The "container" for supplementary materials is a separate document, 
and these materials should be submitted using an appropriate field on 
the review form. 

#### Anonymity

As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors’ names
and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author’s
identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …“ must be avoided.
Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …“
Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected
without review.

### Paper Submission and Templates

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management
system. The submission site is open at:

<https://www.softconf.com/acl2018/papers/>

Long/short paper submissions must use the official ACL 2018 style
templates. Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content. Short
papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content. References do not
count against these limits.

-   [LaTeX]({{ site.github.url }}/downloads/acl18-latex.zip) ([acl_natbib.bst]({{ site.github.url }}/downloads/acl_natbib.bst) updated at Feb. 8)
-   [Microsoft Word]({{ site.github.url }}/downloads/acl18-word.zip)

All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official
style guidelines, which are contained in these template files.

### Multiple Submission Policy

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must indicate this at submission time in the START
submission form, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted
by ACL 2018. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at ACL 2018
must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to
whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication
or presentation the papers that overlap significantly in content or
results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

Authors submitting more than one paper to ACL 2018 must ensure that
submissions do not overlap significantly (&gt;25%) with each other in
content or results.

## ACL Author Guidelines

ACL 2018 adopts the following guidelines for submission and citation.
Submissions that do not conform to these guidelines will be rejected
without review.

### Preserving Double Blind Review

The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of
double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The
rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month
before the submission deadline up to the date when your paper is either
accepted, rejected, or withdrawn.

-   You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available
    online to the general community (for example, via a preprint
    server) during the anonymity period. By a version of a paper we
    understand another paper having essentially the same scientific
    content but possibly differing in minor details (including title
    and structure) and/or in length (e.g., an abstract is a version of
    the paper that it summarizes).

-   If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online
    before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an
    anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must
    not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the
    program chair(s) that a non-anonymized version exists. You may not
    update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and
    we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other
    actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing
    during the anonymity period.

-   Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous
    version available online before the start of the anonymity period,
    this does make double-blind reviewing more difficult to maintain,
    and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end of the
    anonymity period if possible. Alternatively, you may consider
    submitting your work to the Computational Linguistics journal,
    which does not require anonymization and has a track for "short"
    (i.e., conference-length) papers.

### Citation and Comparison

If you are aware of previous research that appears sound and is relevant
to your work, you should cite it even if it has not been peer-reviewed,
and certainly if it influenced your own work. However, refereed
publications take priority over unpublished work reported in preprints.
Specifically:

-   You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your
    submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all
    unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted
    and/or is not widely cited).

-   In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed
    publication, the refereed publication should be cited in addition
    to or instead of the preprint version.

Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the
submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission,
and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that
require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.

## Presentation Requirement

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the
proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register
for ACL 2018 by the early registration deadline.

[Student Research Workshop][srwmain] collocated with ACL 2018, Melbourne, Australia

**Paper Submission Deadline: April 8, 2018**
 
### General Rules for Submission

The ACL 2018 Student Research Workshop (SRW) provides a forum for student researchers who are investigating various areas related to Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for student participants to present their work and receive valuable feedback from the international research community as well as from selected panelists - experienced researchers, specifically assigned according to the topic of their work, who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the presentation. The workshop's goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education: from those in the final stages of undergraduate training to those active with graduate thesis research. The SRW invites two types of submissions:

- **Research Papers**: completed work or work-in-progress along with preliminary results. We encourage submissions from Ph.D. students, as well as Masters or advanced undergraduate students.
- **Research Proposals**: for advanced Masters and Ph.D. students who have decided on a thesis topic and are interested in feedback about their proposal and ideas about future directions for their work.

This year we provide two mentoring programs:

- Pre-submission Mentoring: the goal is to improve presentation of the student's work, not to critique the work itself. Mentors will provide feedback in the format of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing.
- Mentoring for Accepted Papers: mentors will be responsible for providing feedback to students and preparing in-depth comments and questions prior to the workshop presentation.

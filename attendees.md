### Visas for International Attendees

The [visa information site](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visi/visi) of the Australian Department of Home Affairs is the authoritative source of information about visa requirements for visitors to Australia, including the application process. The [Home Affairs travel site](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/) also contains additional information about travelling to Australia. Any further information in this section is provided for convenience only, and you should check the Home Affairs site for the most comprehensive and up-to-date information.

In general all foreign nationals will require a visa of some kind to attend the conference. Please make sure you leave enough time for your visa application to be processed. The processing time depends on the class of visa you apply for.

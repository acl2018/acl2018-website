title: ACL 2018 Conference App
---

ACL 2018 is pleased to announce that we have a conference app, to assist with:

* Networking, by allowing you to contact other participants who have consented to be placed on the participant list.
* Planning your attendance at the event, to find out what talks are or sessions are scheduled, where the sessions are, and to add them to your personalised agenda (this functionality is also available [on this site](/programme/schedule), but participants may find the app a preferable interface with better offline support. Note that any personalised agenda you set up on one will not be synced to the other.)

The conference app is powered by [Whova](https://whova.com), and the app is available for 
* [iOS on the iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whova-event-cse25/id716979741?ls=1&mt=8)
* [Android on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whova.event)
* Other platforms (including desktop) as a [mobile-optimised webapp](https://whova.com/webapp/e/amoac), but this does not have the full feature set of the native mobile apps

You can also simply search for 'Whova' on your mobile device directly. After downloading the app you can find the ACL 2018 in the list of upcoming conferences, and receive the invitation code for the conference itself by email after signing in to Whova.
